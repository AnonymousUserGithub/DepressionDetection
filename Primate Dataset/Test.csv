And when I will come to therapist I dont know what to say, what if that day I will feel fine and they will not believe me? I dont look like I struggle all the time, people around me dont even know that I have problems, Ive always been a comedian in a company.

597,Hello I need some advice about this.,"Hello, I have been dating my girlfriend for a while now.

She has been dealing with depression most of her life. She bravely decided first semester of freshman year of college of last year to go to therapy. She is also doing her best to recover from self harm.I dont know her exact severity but the college has her on a watchlist. She really wants to change but has trouble getting out of the mentality she has grown up with for so long. She has planned to take her life but from what I can gather she has postponed it. To quote her: ""You [referring me] will never know I'm gone if I did"" meaning she wouldnt tell anyone. At night when she is alone is when she feels the most depressed, to the point where sometimes she has become a nihilist and only wants her death. I understand that it's all up to her to change and her suicidal tendencies dont mean she doesnt love me. Unfortunately due to our situations we became long distance partners. However, I have done what I think is good support. My questions that I have are:

What can I do to better support her?
Is there some things that I need to say or do to better support her?

Feel free to ask more to get a better gauge on the situation. I'd appreciate if you guys want to discuss deeper into it though if we do, could it be through private messaging as I wouldnt want the comments to be filled with so much info. 

Thank you so much for listening. Any and all help is appreciated.","Hello I need some advice about this.Hello, I have been dating my girlfriend for a while now.

63,I feel myself slipping again,"I’ve been at February vacation away from school  this year and I can’t help but feel I’ve been wasting it.

1304,Depression keeps getting worse and worse.,"Hey guys, I’m new to this sub and I’m seeking advice as well as motivation to keep pushing forward in life. I’m about to turn 20 and I need help. Everything had been stuck for months and I can’t move forward no matter how hard I try, I just get pushed down again. I take medication for it but nothing has worked long term. I’m starting to eat healthy and I’m trying to exercise more often but even getting the motivation for that is extremely challenging. I feel like my girlfriend doesn’t love me or care about me anymore and all I do is wake up and go to sleep depressed. I can’t hold a steady job, I can barely maintain a decent mood for more than an hour or even a half hour at a time. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, also known as BPD, and my therapists and psychologist both believe that this untreated mental illness is what is causing everything. I’ve faced numerous extremely traumatic events in my life that I have yet to accept/conquer and I really don’t know what I’m doing anymore. If anybody has anything I’m all ears because I’m all out of ideas. If you got this far, thanks for reading.

327,I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation.,"*(tl;dr at the bottom)*

Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isn't one of them. But it is the problem of my now ex-boyfriend.  
He isn't someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but it's hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of ""I don't know"".  
So I thought I'd ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he can't (Of course I know that you can just make guesses but I'm trying really hard to understand him and I'm just so confused.)  
We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldn't say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when he's feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. That's why we're not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didn't see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks I'm feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. (Which I think is true and at the same time isn't... It's definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we weren't already there where I would like my relationship to be.)  
That was two months ago. We're still texting each day and sometimes meet - we're not having sex or kissing but still, he doesn't treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesn't want to. We're officially broken up... but we're not just friends.   
I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didn't think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this - although it seems that this didn't improve anything for him.   
He said he doesn't know what his feelings for me are but he doesn't want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend.  
I don't know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, he's doing nothing to improve his situation and I can't take this much longer.   
I know that most people - especially in the relationship subreddits...  -  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. To confirm that I'm not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, I've talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that they're confused, too, and also think that his behavior isn't that of ""just a friend"".

And now, I'm still here because I've seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. I have the feeling that the actual reason for the break-up and what's standing between us aren't not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. Many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and I don't just want to leave this awesome person behind because he's going through a hard time.  


**tl;dr**: Boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. His reasons didn't sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression. Doesn't know what he feels for me but doesn't want to lose me and wanted time to think and work on his problems - but isn't really doing anything. I have the feeling he wants to be with me but his depression prevent him from doing so. I'm so confused and don't know what to think or how to help him.

So... I'm not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly I'm looking for... I guess I just want to hear some other thoughts on this.

35,How do I make a female partner who's depressed feel better?,"(**repost because i forgot to use my alt)**

Hey guys. So I'm hanging out with my girlfriend on Friday, who is depressed and may have some sort of bpd issues (as pointed out by multiple redditors). They have been irritable and angry for a long time, and there's a lot on her mind, so I'm giving them the week without talking to her to recollect her. I was hoping to get everyone's advice on how I should talk to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make clear that they does not think she's depressed, but all symptoms are there. irritability, feeling of emptiness, mood swings, sadness, (sometimes) excessive substance intake. they even admitted they were depressed a while ago and had thoughts of killing or harming herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I am worried about her and if she won't accept and get help herself, I'm trying to see how I can make things better. The stuff I have planned out on Friday are:

1. I surprise her by letting her choose what I get her for valentine's day
2. We cuddle and watch a movie or something
3. She goes out with some friends who are moving away
4. when she's back, we hang out again and maybe watch our favorite tv show.
5. play some kind of video game or just talk

Are any of you able to tell me what else I can do to make my partner feel happier? Like whether it's daily or what I can just do on Friday. I want her to come out of her rut and be happy like she was once before. I'm really trying to make it fun but not suffocate her. We've been fighting a lot lately and it got pretty bad so I'm willing to do whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

992,What is it normal to feel after a suicide attempt?,"This is possibly triggering for a lot of people.

On Tuesday evening I tried to end my life but (obviously) was unsuccessful. I was taken to the hospital and given all the treatment. Spoke to a man who is a mental health specialist then I went home.

I don’t know what I feel. I guess I feel extremely anxious. I feel  like I should be more sad or depressed than I am. But honestly I feel numb. I feel guilty for laughing or smiling with my dad (he doesn’t know) because that means I’m fake and I didn’t really mean my attempt.

I’m still getting those thoughts. The more I think of them the more my anxiety increases and I feel like now I’ve pushed past the fear and done something, the uncertainty is not there anymore and it will be easier to next time.","What is it normal to feel after a suicide attempt?This is possibly triggering for a lot of people.

1165,In love with my best friend who doesn’t see me like that.,"So Iv known this guy for over two years now and the moment I met him I started to fall for him. We are both mid 30’s and have a real connection. We actually met from a online hook up at the beginning and he ended up staying here for a few nights, but after a week when I asked him for a date he said he wanted to stay friends as that was more important. I still remember how much it broke my heart then when he rejected me, but we hung out nearly every day. He stayed at my place most of the time and we just became really close. We sleep together whenever we stay at each other’s places, just cuddling. Over the years I have fallen deeper for him and I had already suffered with my own mental health before all this but now I feel so torn.
He is literally my one and only friend, I’m terrified of having another talk about my feelings with him in case I push him away again. 
We didn’t speak for a few months as he wasn’t very understanding that I couldn’t stop loving him. I cried every single day when we stopped talking and this was during lockdown last year. It was awful, I think about him all the time and I have a lot of trouble sleeping with my mind just racing. 
Mostly When I’m with him I genuinely feel myself and happy, but then I always wish for more. 
I don’t know what to do, I feel like if i stepped away again from our friendship I wouldn’t last. It’s not that I want to end my life, but for awhile now I just wish I was dead. He keeps me tethered here, so I don’t know do I just hide my feelings and say nothing and hope the friendship works. 
I would have been a very outgoing, proactive and positive person but I don’t feel that anymore. I burst out crying a few times a day about my life, I don’t really sleep, I can’t really eat which isn’t good cause I’m already v skinny. 
Over the past few years Iv lost many friends to suicide so I know how terrible it is, but lately I really find myself understanding why they did it and tbh I don’t have the guts to go through with it. 
I’m really hoping someone can share some advice, I have done therapy and seen doctors but I didn’t really find it helped. It’s hard to fully open up face to face.","In love with my best friend who doesn’t see me like that.So Iv known this guy for over two years now and the moment I met him I started to fall for him.

I wanna talk about it with people outside my treatment team. So, I've outlined my history and concerns as concisely and as comprehensively I could.. any input is appreciated &lt;3 You can skip sections if you like.

&amp;#x200B;

*Background —*

I’m a young adult female. I’ve struggled with CPTSD for many years now as a result of childhood trauma and adult experiences of abuse+violence. I slipped into a severe depressive episode this year after a sexual assault. I have a caring primary care doctor and a psychiatrist — they want to help me manage the intense levels of panic and depression I’ve recently experienced while using minimal medication. I’ve been on mirtazipine (an antidepressant) for 4 weeks and I’m able to function more (reduced depression but ongoing anxiety). I am also trying to eat more and gain weight as I am underweight.

*“Issues”—*

Nightmares (resulting insomnia), panic attacks that last 2-6 hours, flashbacks, hyper vigilance, dissociation, physical pain, anxiety, depression. I also experience a lot of self doubt and self blame. No history of hallucinations, drug misuse, or violence towards others.

All of the above have improved significantly while being on mirtazipine. I am now able to sleep regularly and eat well when before I was neither able to sleep nor eat due to the level of panic symptoms I was experiencing. Mere improvements in sleep have allowed me to better manage anxiety and panic when they do happen.

*My goals —*

I want help with regulating sleep, food, and mood so I am more equipped to manage triggers and painful memories, while also creating a future worth moving towards. My body’s responses are natural responses to an unnatural situation of abuse. I want to be able to listen to my body and give myself what I need, which is tenderness, kindness, and respect. I expect respect and gentleness from people I interact with as well - it is essential for my healing. I’m not interested in picking apart my trauma or suppressing what is showing up - I want to be able to meet my needs fully.

*Things I’ve tried —*

Medication, therapy, meditation, healthy food, exercise, self care, and trauma informed movement. I’ve found that mind body integration through somatic work + low dose medication is an amazing combo. Talk therapy has felt highly distressing lately (maybe because my providers are not actually trauma informed) even though I’ve been engaged with different types of talk therapy for the last 8 years and had success.

**I feel hurt by my intensive program —**

I started an outpatient intensive partial program (in addition to monthly check ins with my pcp + psychiatrist) and I think it’s doing more harm than good. *This is where I need your thoughts.*

1- The intake staff raised their voice at me but I hoped it’s just the cruel gatekeepers and that the actual staff will be kind because it’s supposed to be trauma informed.

2- I got thrown into a 6 hour day when they told me it will only be a quick 20 minute intake. It instead turned into 6 hours of invasive questioning, classes, and therapy - during which I was required to be present and not eat.

2.1- There was no personal check in or regard for the fact that I was highly disregulated because I wasn’t allowed to move or eat when hungry. This resulted in a 5 hour panic attack after the day ended, nightmares, and inability to sleep. I struggled with severe body aches for 2 days after because of how distressed I was.

3- Part of the program day was meeting with a psychiatrist that immediately fixated on racially targeted questions - “where are you actually from” “why are you here” “what’s your visa status” even though I never brought that up and she assumed I’m foreign because I’m not white. This meeting lasted 13 minutes after which she told me my current medication is incorrect and I need to be on antipsychotics (?) without ever asking me what I need. She interrupted me every time I tried to express what is currently going on. She barely looked at me and spent the whole time eating and looking at the computer. This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program - everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires.

4- I have had no meeting with anyone during or before the program regarding what I need or how this program is customized to me.

5- almost every individual in the program is on medication and there seems to be general push towards strong sedating medication. Most members could not even sit up during groups due to the level of sedation.

6- I have corrected the clinicians and staff over 4 times in a single day with the name they use for me and they continue to use incorrect names for me. I don’t feel respected.

7- The staff seems to treat every action of every client as a sickness. For example, a woman felt emotional anger when someone was rude towards her in public — the staff fixated on the validity or invalidity of that anger instead of the safety needs in that situation.

8- The staff and the program itself feels very paternalizing. Example — a clinician did an activity asking everyone to name “vacation spots” that start with F before jumping into talking about emotional dysregulation and severe distress. The clinician (an intern in training) had a color wheel with activities at the level of a 4th grader for an adult group.

9- The program is apparently owned by a for-profit company and has dangerously negative reviews on google by clients and on LinkedIn+Glassdoor by staff.

458,Advice and help please,"TLDR: I’m underage, depressed and don’t want to involve my parents in this. I don’t have any friend support right now either. Not sure what to do now and feel like just giving up. 

I’m 17 this year and went for a free mental health checkup a few days ago (parental consent and knowledge not needed) which confirmed that I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder. I’ve been feeling the symptoms for a little over a year now and attempted suicide a few months ago. Now that I have confirmed that I have depression, I’m not sure what to do next. They recommended that I look into getting a psychiatrist and psychologist for medicine and counseling respectively, especially since my family has a history of depression. However, since I’m underage, I need parental consent.

I’m not close to either of my parents or any of my siblings and I have quite a lot of bad memories from my childhood as well. Additionally, my father has quite a negative perception of depression which definitely would not help. My younger brother has had suicidal ideation for the past year as well (his school found out and told my parents) so my mom in particular is very concerned about him. I don’t want to burden them further or open up to them about this at all, and since my brother is not mentally well either, I feel that my parents should focus more on him.

At the moment, none of my friends know about this diagnosis and I don’t intend to tell any of them either. I pushed away my two closest friends a few months ago and I don’t trust anyone enough to tell them either. Even if I did, I don’t think they would be able to help much (ranting does not help me much and just makes me feel like a burden). I’m pretty much completely alone now and have no clue what to do. It feels like my only option is to tell my parents even though I really don’t want to and they may react very negatively. Also, I’m very tempted to just let this get worse and worse until I eventually kill myself so that hampers any attempts to get better as well.

448,Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my life,"Hey everybody,

My life itself has always been pretty good, but my quality of life has been awful for the last 8-ish years. I am currently 23, and this is a quick timeline of what's been going on:

* Age 13-14, started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. Also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. Doctor thought it might be anxiety/depression so suggested I see a therapist and try some antidepressants. I tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. Antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. This generalized anxiety/worry/stress feeling continued.
* Age 16, while still dealing with the above, I woke up one day after a good night's sleep and felt a little tired. I attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it NEVER went away. But it was very mild, so I just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. Over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where I'm at now where I can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatigue/brain fog. It is 24/7. Not even a second of feeling better.
* Age 17-present: Have had nearly every sort of medical testing one can have done, many of them multiple times. Food allergy, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, thyroid, cortisol, testosterone, heavy metals, MRI, EEG, EKG, Lyme disease, Epstein Barr, h pylori, sleep apnea, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, increase exercise, etc. Have tried a total of 7 different antidepressants/anxieties from different drug classes to see if maybe depression was the culprit. All either did nothing or made me more tired/foggy. I’ve tried Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, kratom, CBD, kava, and countless other supplements. The stimulants all either helped very slightly, but felt very artificial and made my body more anxious but didn’t help my mind, or didn’t do anything. Caffeine in any form doesn’t help either. I’ve seen 3 different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues. 

I feel this intense dissociation feeling 24/7 that has gradually emerged/worsened over the past couple of years. Like I'm so tired, I don't even feel like I'm in real life ever anymore. I feel drunk/drugged, especially as the day progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking (Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processing/recalling/stumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.). My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzy/lightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. It's almost impossible to startle me. It's like my body doesn't even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxious/stressed/overwhelmed more easily. Everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal I get to check off. Even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. Hypersomnia (Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia). Vision has declined (eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity). Eyes are dry/watery off and on. Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremities/body parts feel so utterly exhausted and numb-like to the touch. Like I can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but can’t feel my hand touching my arm. Senses feel dulled (Hearing, taste, smell, touch) all feel weakened and suppressed, especially as the day goes on and I feel more tired. Sex drive is virtually non-existent. Alcohol hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easily/quickly. Sometimes 1 beer and I'm already feeling really drunk. I’m slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I don't get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as I’ve gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 24/7. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every cold/flu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day and/or when I’m more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to “recover”, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when I’m sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc.

Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like it's suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeine’s effect, sex drive, post-workout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. It’s like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but I'm just too out of it, it's embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie when I try.

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically, the last kind of test I can do at this point is a sleep study, which is in a few weeks. In a way, sadly, I hope they find something. Any advice is greatly appreciated.","Years of worsening chronic fatigue/fog continue to cripple my lifeHey everybody,

282,Cleaning service?,"I feel lots of shame posting this.

I pretty much live in my partner's room (she lives with roommates). Both of us have depression &amp; anxiety symptoms flaring up, and she has chronic pain. We've been very isolated to our room. It's already been cluttered and disorganized by her move 1 year ago, and since we have very little energy, it's more and more cluttered, including boxes of take-out.

Its state affects us very much and though we've tried again and again to gain motivation and energy to at least do small things, we haven't been able to do much.

We talked a few times about reaching out for someone to clean and reorganize our room. I also know a few skill-trading groups where I could ask for help, and offer some kind of compensation. I also thought of asking friends for help, but I'm scared of imposing. We don't have that much money either, but honestly we haven't been able to do much for a while now and I just need help to take a step forward. I just feel like I'm being very lazy doing so. And I'm not sure where to start. Did anyone considered or tried doing something like that? Does it make sense?","Cleaning service?I feel lots of shame posting this.

I’m trying to decide between ketamine therapy and microdosing to help instead of traditional meds as the medication I’m on now seems to be causing more issues, as well as ones in the past. I would ideally like to try something else rather than another new anti depressant.

1015,Severe depression,"Something many people don't understand is that being suicidal isn't always ""I want to kill myself""

I wouldn't want to do that. But I just want to die. I just want all the thoughts screaming in my head to stop. It's like I'm underwater at a busy public pool and just hearing constant yelling and shouting. Not voices but just thoughts. 

I'm thinking about getting hospitalized. I need to get help. I need to get out of my house. I'm in a hoarding situation. Like I DO want to get rid of stuff and organize. But I have zero energy to do so. I get so overwhelmed when I start. I want to reach out for help and have others come over to help me but I'm afraid of being judged for how bad it's gotten.

I just want to go to sleep and not wake up so I can escape everything

I tried to talk to my boyfriend about it tonight and hit a total brick wall with him. Like he means well but he went right into the whole ""but you have so many good things, why are you so depressed?"" I physically cannot articulate how much that hurts. So I shut right back down again.","Severe depressionSomething many people don't understand is that being suicidal isn't always ""I want to kill myself""

My job closed back at the start of the pandemic. I was off work for almost a year and a half. Things were actually starting to look up the last few weeks/months. I was slowly becoming productive again. Getting closer ot feeling normal. I was actually making progress on my portfolio and studying, to get a job that I don't hate.

But my job opened up again last week. It's been 3 days. And already, it feels as though I've spiralled all the way back down to exactly where I was before. It feels as though this horrible dark cloud is hanging over me again.

I feel permantently exhausted. Too tired and on edge to get on with anything. Everything just feels like this big, anxious bad dream, slowly counting down to when I'm next working. I just feel a constant dread, waiting for the next shift.

114,Trying to initiate self care,"22f here, new to this subreddit. Due to depression and lack of budget for healthier foods (i work part time for 7.75 an hour) I've gained more weight than I'm comfortable with. I would like to balance out my poor eating habits (since I'm living off of the cheapest things i can afford- ramen, chef boyardee, you get the picture) with more physical fitness. I have a few medical problems that prevent me from being as active as I'd like. A few years ago i had an accident and broke my spine so i have hardware implanted and a bum hip. Even taking a six hour shift at work leaves me all but unable to walk the next day. I've started taking walks, and since i live in a rough part of an inner city its difficult to be by myself and not have someone harrass me or follow me. I can't afford a gym membership so i was wondering if anyone had tips or suggestions on how i can do more from my home. If it matters I'd like to focus on my stomach and love handles, its just hard because of my back and hip problems to do a bunch of situps and pushups and leg lifts. Does anyone know how to do these to reduce my pain so i can keep going longer for better results? My body image issues are really starting to affect me, and they havent before... I will be crossposting as well in a health advice subreddit. Any suggestions and tips are welcome. TIA!","Trying to initiate self care22f here, new to this subreddit.

755,Does anyone else just not want to be alive but isn’t actively suicidal?,"So I’ve just been feeling really depressed in a really long time. I would say last year I was extremely suicidal and I was on the verge of ending my life. But then it got complicated I got help and blah blah... I thought my meds were working after I reached a therapeutic level of 125mg of Zoloft but I’m not sure anymore. These overwhelming feelings are coming back. 

I mean I’m not actively suicidal or anything. But then today my sister asked me where I wanted to live in the future, and the first thing that cam to mind is that I didn’t want even live. I’m just so tired of this perpetual cycle of shit. It’s really getting draining.

 Anyways does anyone else feel this way, dead inside a little I guess. And do you guys think my meds aren’t working? I was okay until like 4 PM today. I would appreciate your opinion.

And I’m totally fine so you don’t need to message me, please save it for someone in urgent need!

425,I've been alone for so long I think I'm losing communication skills,"My parents make going out and having fun really difficult especially my step dad who constantly tracks my phone location and my bank information. He makes sure to mention every time I withdraw my own hard earned money from my account making me subconsciously feel wrong just for using my own money. Same thing with going out with my friends, he makes me feel wrong for wanting to have fun, instead he just cares about me working my youth away as a slave for someone else just for this fucking money that I hate so dearly. 

It's been like this for me basically forever, I've constantly had elders over me telling me what I should do, what I shouldn't do, things I must seek out, thinks I can't touch with a 10 foot pole etc. and I'm sick and fucking tired of it. At no point in my short life have I personally be able to make my own choices or decisions and now that that's been my life when it actually comes to me personally making decisions for myself I don't know how to. It feels like I need someone with me at all times to help me make decisions because I've never had the opportunity for myself to make decisions, someone else always was ""more obligated"" to make decisions for me instead of myself and now I'm a complete wreck in life because of it. I think this method of raising me plus child abuse is why I just feel so isolated in this reality now. 

But now I think all this loneliness in my life is finally starting to add up and take its toll on me. In school from elementary until I hit puberty at around 7th-8th grade I was a goofy class clown fun person who had no problem making people laugh and brighten up the whole room. But when my hair started thinning around 9th grade I started to get significantly more and more shy and more depressed and withdrawn from other people out  of fear of being judged for being ""weird"" or ""awkward"" eventually this fear caught up with me my junior and senior years of high school where every single person I'd have ever interacted with would judge my appearance or my hair because of how poorly it looked. I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead.

Now that I've been shy and lonely for so long when I actually try to talk to people I have a hard time forming the appropriate sentence to match what the person had said to me. Or I might form the sentence awkwardly making my point much harder to come across to them. I feel like I have to stop and really put together a sentence in my head before I can say it or else it'll just not make any sense when the person I'm talking to finally hears my response. Or I'll hesitate while talking and then it'll mess up the flow of what I was talking about and I can't piece back together the sentence I was trying to say. I've slowly became more and more self aware at how many times I've had to just completely scrape a sentence midway through because of this hesitation while trying to speak, people probably think I'm crazy by now.

I have nothing interesting to tell people either so when I'm at work and the person who's talking to me shares a story about them that happened recently I feel like I'm not given back to the conversation because I have no story at all other than depressing stories to share in the conversation, so 9/10 times I'm simply forced to only comment about their story instead of sharing my own stories. Otherwise I don't talk at all, not unless someone else starts up a conversation with me. I kinda don't even like talking to people anymore because it just feels like it's getting really difficult to make a conversion work when I'm a part of it. Only being able to reply to their experiences instead of giving them insight on my own personal experiences. I also have a extremely difficult time looking people in their eyes for more than a second, maintaining eye contact just feels really uncomfortable.

I feel so much pressure from other people too, like if I drop something I instantly feel like everyone is watching me as I pick it back up. Or when I was in school literally just standing up to turn my paper in made me feel like people would judge me for my appearance or how I walked or whatever. Being in the presence of anyone makes my life significantly more difficult, like I have to play a role in front of them so I can't be judged for being myself.","I've been alone for so long I think I'm losing communication skillsMy parents make going out and having fun really difficult especially my step dad who constantly tracks my phone location and my bank information. He makes sure to mention every time I withdraw my own hard earned money from my account making me subconsciously feel wrong just for using my own money. Same thing with going out with my friends, he makes me feel wrong for wanting to have fun, instead he just cares about me working my youth away as a slave for someone else just for this fucking money that I hate so dearly. 

It's been like this for me basically forever, I've constantly had elders over me telling me what I should do, what I shouldn't do, things I must seek out, thinks I can't touch with a 10 foot pole etc. and I'm sick and fucking tired of it. At no point in my short life have I personally be able to make my own choices or decisions and now that that's been my life when it actually comes to me personally making decisions for myself I don't know how to. It feels like I need someone with me at all times to help me make decisions because I've never had the opportunity for myself to make decisions, someone else always was ""more obligated"" to make decisions for me instead of myself and now I'm a complete wreck in life because of it. I think this method of raising me plus child abuse is why I just feel so isolated in this reality now. 

But now I think all this loneliness in my life is finally starting to add up and take its toll on me. In school from elementary until I hit puberty at around 7th-8th grade I was a goofy class clown fun person who had no problem making people laugh and brighten up the whole room. But when my hair started thinning around 9th grade I started to get significantly more and more shy and more depressed and withdrawn from other people out  of fear of being judged for being ""weird"" or ""awkward"" eventually this fear caught up with me my junior and senior years of high school where every single person I'd have ever interacted with would judge my appearance or my hair because of how poorly it looked. I felt like I resembled a corpse because of how dead inside I really started to become, and even became more and more obsessed with death and wanting to be dead.

Now that I've been shy and lonely for so long when I actually try to talk to people I have a hard time forming the appropriate sentence to match what the person had said to me. Or I might form the sentence awkwardly making my point much harder to come across to them. I feel like I have to stop and really put together a sentence in my head before I can say it or else it'll just not make any sense when the person I'm talking to finally hears my response. Or I'll hesitate while talking and then it'll mess up the flow of what I was talking about and I can't piece back together the sentence I was trying to say. I've slowly became more and more self aware at how many times I've had to just completely scrape a sentence midway through because of this hesitation while trying to speak, people probably think I'm crazy by now.

I have nothing interesting to tell people either so when I'm at work and the person who's talking to me shares a story about them that happened recently I feel like I'm not given back to the conversation because I have no story at all other than depressing stories to share in the conversation, so 9/10 times I'm simply forced to only comment about their story instead of sharing my own stories. Otherwise I don't talk at all, not unless someone else starts up a conversation with me. I kinda don't even like talking to people anymore because it just feels like it's getting really difficult to make a conversion work when I'm a part of it. Only being able to reply to their experiences instead of giving them insight on my own personal experiences. I also have a extremely difficult time looking people in their eyes for more than a second, maintaining eye contact just feels really uncomfortable.

I feel so much pressure from other people too, like if I drop something I instantly feel like everyone is watching me as I pick it back up. Or when I was in school literally just standing up to turn my paper in made me feel like people would judge me for my appearance or how I walked or whatever.

1744,24yo disabled female wants to reset my life,"I’ve recently come to the conclusion that no matter what I do with my life; it doesn’t improve or move anywhere.

I’m 24yo, confined to an electric wheelchair from a condition that no one can tell me if I will degenerate from or not, I’ve never been in a serious relationship and every dating experience I’ve had has ended in disaster and heartbreak that’s taken me months to get over. 

I’m a writer, but never seem to be able to get a job in it, no matter how much I apply for. My recent job in a TV company has ended, so I have nothing to do with my time anymore.

I only have two friends who I don’t feel close to anymore. They both live busy, fulfilling lives with their significant others and don’t remember have time to hang out anymore.

My mom is quite controlling and still treats me like a child, so I’ve been unable to get my own Carer to have some independence.

My sisters are both in relationships and make me feel depressed with their fulfilling lives, yet my mom doesn’t believe me when I say I need therapy and will only pay for my sister to see a therapist.

I feel like my life is going nowhere as it’s got progressively worse over the past five years, and due to my disability I’m unable to easily self harm in a way which would get me help.

Please; can someone help me find something to live for, as I really can’t find it anymore","24yo disabled female wants to reset my lifeI’ve recently come to the conclusion that no matter what I do with my life; it doesn’t improve or move anywhere.

902,What would you do in my position?,"I’m a pretty young boy still trying to develop my character. I’m in high school. I like to think I’m more mature than other people my age. Before I go into why I’m so unsure about something, I’m just going to give you some background story if you care to read it. 

Background:
In elementary school I was verbally abused by racism and many other factors. I was always picked on for some unknown reason. I like to think I was a very optimistic kid. However, those years was a turning point into how I ended up. I took this bullying pretty hard. I lived in fear the following year. I didn’t tell anyone about how I felt. I remember crying almost daily. 2 years after the bullying crisis I started to feel like I healed. I thought I made true friends that year which end up being really bad. I was ignored by that person for who knows what. I started to hang out with girls more as friends. I felt they were more understanding. I think it affected how I act because I remember changing my personality 3 times. People started to tell me that I act like a girl. Even my own parents. So I changed myself again. I became more and more less optimistic. I became more dry and alone. That following year, those friends I made (who were the girls) was a mess. I was a mess. I was so much in pain I did so many stupid things. I don’t even want to talk about those moments. I felt targeted by that friend and victimized. I was in fear that year too. At that moment I accepted that it was better for me to not have friends or anyone to care for me. I made this conclusion because my parents weren’t all that understanding either. I tried telling them how I feel multiple times, but they give me the answer that hurts even more. “There are people having it worse than you” (which I agree. But I don’t think that’s the main issue. I think the part they should see is how their issue effects that person). “You’re crying over a girl”(I’m relating to that one year I was victimized). It didn’t help that my brother is also illogical and not as mature as me. He’s younger than me but I was more matured than he was when I was his age. But everybody is different. That’s was me trying to say everything in short terms. And here I am present day. 


Quarantine made me feel more alone than anything. I thought I was used to dealing things on my own. These experiences that I’ve faced really made me think that there’s no one that understands me. I do these small things that no one does and I have a valid reason for why I chose to do it, but no one understands what I’m saying. I feel extremely excluded. Even to my own sexuality. Everyday I feel different. I feel so unnatural. I’m thinking it’s because I became unsure of who I am as a person because I changed myself so much. To make others more satisfied with me. I wanted to not be lonely. But changing myself made it worse. Death threats were made, insults about my physical appearance were made everyday, and I had no one to talk about it to. I envisioned my life being so happy 1 night. I had a friend who was caring and really nice. He was a true friend. I think what I’m trying to say here is that I feel so unloved and excluded. I feel that no one cared about how I felt. I had no one to talk to my feelings to so I became more irritated over little things. And no one in my life bothered to understand why. They thought I had low-temper. Which is not true. It’s really hard to explain all of these mix emotions I have in me. I remember my mom told me that I rely on others and not my parents. I could never tell them that I tried many times before that which came to no avail. I’m not diagnosed either. I always lie on those doctor depression paper thing because my dad watches me fill those out which raises my anxiety levels. 


Also a side note: 
I’m a person who is fearful. I tend to not believe what happened and become regretful of many things. It’s a major flaw that I try to get rid of. It’s really hard to explain. I tend to be so caught up in the past that I can’t accept what’s in front of me. I can’t interpret what’s happening in that moment. 

What would you do if you were me? I don’t want my parents involved because they won’t understand me at all. I don’t want to tell my brother because he’s so illogical and I think he hates me for whatever reason. I have no friends to talk to that would understand me. And I have no confidence to stand up myself at this point. What would you do?","What would you do in my position?I’m a pretty young boy still trying to develop my character. I’m in high school.

1624,What is the point?,"I have been suffering from depression i suppose all my life. However, acknowledgment of it only came 3-4 years ago. Since acknowledging i have depression, each passing year since I get worst and worst. These last two years have been my lowest with contemplation of harm getting harder to ignore. 

My 30th birthday was earlier this year and 4 days leading to it the idea of not seeing that birthday was painfully strong. I have no social life. the one friend that i confided in, that relationship has drastically changed. I have no romantic life, and havnt dated in 6 years. and i have no career, recently quitting my job as my mental health plumited, however now i dont think i am good enough for any job so the motivation to look just brings about anxiety and self hate.

I also started therapy the same time i got the perscription and see them one a week. However, although talking out my feelings gives me temporary relief i still dont know the tools needed to be better.

551,I am beyond Pissed of spiraling out of control and need someone to help sort me.,I felt like maybe I was growing in the last 6 months. I made a group of friends I could talk to for the first time. A group that would hang out all the time have a great time and just do everything together. About 2 months in I opened up to one of them after having really bad day. They said I could always trust them and they wouldn’t leave me. Here I am a few months later and they call saying that they can’t come and talk to me ever when I need it. I told them I was overwhelming as a person because I’m so depressed and negative and that they would want to be done and they would stop coming over when I needed help. I was told however “don’t worry I won’t ever leave you alone”  but as I had expected I was right and now they are giving up. I am beyond angered and sad and frustrated that I put all of my trust 100% into this person who even has told me to open up to the rest of that group. But now the whole group has a slight fear of me because depression is scary even for people who aren’t actually depressed because they just don’t know what to do sometimes. I am no longer treated the same by the rest of the group and the one I trusted with everything has left me in complete shambles and my mind is freaking out.

1152,Girlfriend started taking antidepressants and pushing me away,"Hi (24 M)my gf of 4 years (22F) has - I believe- been struggling with various degrees of depression for a very llong time (probably since before i met her) but she only recently (1 week) started to get some medical help. She just got worse. She rarely talks to me and when she does it is short answers. Most of our conversations are about her telling me how shitty she feels, sick, or seeing/hearing stuff because of the meds or how she just wants to sleep all day. I decided to give her some space but today I really felt like calling her to check up on her and in the first 30 seconds of the call she started acting like an asshole to me and i got pissed. I now feel shitty about it because i know she is struggling but at the same time I won't be treated like a carpet.It's important to know we live close by but I've been out of the country for almost 2 months now so we haven't seen each other in a while ( I should return in a few weeks).

I don't know how to help her. I told her to ""hold on"" until the meds can help her but I am at my wit's end, feeling like I am losing her. Help me to help her please

171,Placing too much on outside help?,"Hello,

I (20m) am a Junior in college. I have dealt with social anxiety, self esteem issues, and most recently depression for nearly half my life. It was a result of reactionary behavior (I caused my own problems) and I have never been able to shake it, as I tell myself I am incapable of change. (Cause yourself problems once, you will sure as hell cause them again) 

I have been spiraling (more or less) over the last few years, and only now am I sane enough to look at my lifelong issues. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new city where I know no one. 

The loneliness has recently gotten to my head, and that combined with the stressfulness of college has me incredibly overwhelmed. Suicide has been on my mind more and more lately until I told myself today I would do it. But here I am. 

I have an appointment with a therapy clinic lined up on 5/9 (May 9th - USA), but I do feel guilty to an extent. All that goes through my head upon dealing with my problems is “tell the therapist and they will assist you in making sense of it”. 

This has me feel irresponsible and ridiculous. There has been many people in life who can’t afford help and have gotten along just fine. It’s your life, and at the end of the day it’s on you to fix it. Yet at the same time I am so lost. All that goes through my head is my inner critic, saying it’s pointless. 

Sorry to ramble. My point being, those who have had success beating their issues on their own, what techniques/routines/activities did you use / partake in?  What helped change your perspectives? 

Any feedback is appreciated thanks for reading if for some reason you got this far","Placing too much on outside help?Hello,

1571,I'm not sure how to tell my mother I'm depressed,"Trigger warning (NSFW) : there will be mentions of self harm

Before anyone jumps to any conclusions please know I love my mother. She's has an interesting way of handling situations. She just wants best for me and everyone and doesn't know how to handle certain situations. 

I think the beginning was 7th grade. It's the age when I'm told kids around my age go through their adolescent stage. They become defiant of their parents and so forth. I'm not sure if this is applicable for everyone but I was one of the kids who defied their parents and acted like a brat. I'm certain from grade 7 it was just my teenage phase but now I'm not sure because at grade 8 and 9 these mood swings got progressively worse and I began to act more sad than just moody. 

In grade 9 I ended up going to the office to have a talk with the counselor. Don't shame me for this but I had just began to use social media and my account was small so only my friends knew my account. Maybe it was for the better but I had posted on my story that I was going to c*t myself for everyone friend of mine. (During this time my family was in the rough. My parents were talking about divorce because they were living apart for too long and their gears just didn't click well together after being apart for too long and just recently getting to live with each other.) I don't know what had gotten to me (because I probably shouldn't have posted such a sensitive topic) but I posted it but didn't completely follow through with it. I did very minor scratches. Maybe I was seeking comfort and attention. Anyways, I had posted it, this concerned my friends and it went all the way to the schools counselor and I ended up having a talk. 

I just bawled during the counsel meeting and asked if this would get to my parents and the counselor said yes. I didn't want to let my parents know because it would simply add fuel into the fire with my parents constantly talking about divorce. Anyways long story short this got to my parents and things got just a bit messier. My parents fought and mentioned my ""problems"" and blamed one another and it was difficult. 

(For those curious my parents didn't divorce they apologized with each other and made up)

After I had arrived home from the counsel meeting I had a talk with both my parents. It was funny because my dad asked me if he could see the c*ts and told me he used to have depression like me and told me he understood. My mom on the other hand was informed by the counselor I was recommended to see a therapist and my mom said, her words: ""teens hitting their puberty stage"". The counselor once again pushed the idea of meeting a counselor and had a small heated debate with my mom about it. My mom backed off and said she would meet one and left with me. We got in the car and the first thing my mom mentioned was that I wasn't going to see a therapist. She said a bunch of things about being upset she didn't know I was going through this and thought it was just me being pubescent but ultimately she was telling me she didn't believe in mental issues. 

She told me I wasn't depressed and that I was just pubescent. Grade 9 and 10 ended relatively smoothly with no self harming just minor break downs and uncontrollable mood swings. Grade 11 came and my previously clean record had relapsed. To this day despite having recently graduated I still unfortunately self harm as a way to cope from unstable emotions. 

The counselor told me I was depressed and have anxiety and others who listened to my rants and stories have told me similar to what the counselor said. 

I'm not sure what to do seeing I have doubts that I have depression because I'm comparing my issues to others and I currently don't understand myself with constant emotional numbness and random attacks of sadness. 

I wish to seek therapy but can't without my parents approval. My mother still doesn't believe in mental disorders and issues and I can't talk to her about these issues because she will take them as me talking back to her. 

I can't talk to my dad either because he will end up talking to my mom about it. 

Should I talk to my mother about my depression, self harm and seek therapy? If so how should I approach my mother without her telling me I'm just going through my pubescent stages (still) and making up a story.

The problem is that I’ve been feeling frustrated and numb ever since. I have barely any energy and am just “proud” that I get out of bed in the morning. Whenever I genuinely feel something it is a mix of anger against myself and frustration. What would you do to overcome this?

879,Wife wants space to fight depression,"Sorry if wrong thread but I feel like maybe people have more first hand experience with something like this.

So a month ago, my wife moved out of our home after admitting that her depression has taken its toll on her and she gave me the old quote 'I love you, but I'm not in love with you'.  We have been married just shy of a year but have been together for 6 years prior to that.  

She was distraught when she dropped that bombshell on me and I felt my whole world crumble.  She is adamant that I havent done anything wrong and that I've done nothing but care, respect and been loyal to her and she feels ashamed to feel like this, and she just needs to have time and space for her self to figure out herself and if she got into a relationship with me for the right reasons (she was in 2 really toxic relationships previously and then started a relationship straight away with me, and she doesnt know if I was a crutch for her or if it was genuine).

For a while she has been unhappy with her job, the house we live in and our financial situation (finances are now pretty much resolved after making some sacrifices) and also with lockdown she has essentially been a prisoner in her own home for 3 weeks.

I have given her the perfect opportunity to tell me if she was having an affair. I told her that if she told me the honest truth, I will not react in anger or resentment, and I would just accept her decision and I would have to think things through for a while.  She again has been adamant there is nobody else involved. 

She has booked her self in for councelling with her depression and I think that starts pretty soon.

I feel in complete limbo land at the moment and I feel scared and alone and worried about what the future holds.  I have made contingency plans if things go south.  I speak to friends and family about this situation and the advice is poor at the best of times.   People keep telling me that I should give her an ultimatum and pressure her into coming back, which I know is completely wrong and it's something I should not do.  I have made the conscious decision to fight with every strand of my being to save this marriage and I will not be the one that ends it.

Things have been fairly positive, we have met up at least once a week for walks/coming over for dinner etc etc.  But it's all very friendly, but I do say that I love her every now and then.  She wants to take things one step at a time and she is open to marriage counselling, if the mental health counselling doesnt work out.

I think deep down she still loves me even though she doesnt say it or that she misses me but does slip in the odd soppy nickname here and there. Might be just a habit, I dont know.  She still clearly cares about me because the other day she barged into the house after my phone wasn't receiving sending calls or texts and I didnt let her know I was safe at home. She also does other things like picks things off me like the odd scab and blackhead here and there, cut my hair and hugs me in a meaningful manner. 

I feel like I may be rambling a bit here, I want to feel positive about things but I am really struggling.  I am putting a brave face on for her so she has less pressure, but anytime we part ways I sob uncontrollably for hours because i just love her so much and want her to come home.

Has anyone else gone through something similar with their spouse? Any tips? I've been extremely self critical and I can see there are improvements I can make to make the relationship better.  Especially now we have more financial freedom.  But with lockdown still in force, it makes things 10x more difficult.

TL;DR 
My wife wants space to find out what she wants.  She says I've done nothing wrong.  We still talk and meet up.  Marriage counselling after her individual counselling.  I'm hurting and want neutral advice.","Wife wants space to fight depressionSorry if wrong thread but I feel like maybe people have more first hand experience with something like this.

All I am is a waste of space, time, resources, and thought and although things may be temporarily shitty for some people if I were to kill myself, I think it'd be overall worth it and beneficial for others in the end.

I lost enjoyment in most things months or years ago and am just exhausted of forcing myself to be positive to others and trying to not let my misery show. Right now, there are only three things are really keeping me from doing it; I don't want others to feel like they could have done something (which is an almost inevitable outcome), I don't want my younger siblings to not have an older brother to look up to, and I have an ever decreasing hope of things getting better.

1208,Birthday tomorrow...,"Well tomorrow is my birthday. I feel numb. You could hit me and I wouldn’t feel it. I usually get all excited and think about how to do my hair and make up, what I want to eat for dinner. I remember all my past birthdays. 
The past few weeks I have just thought about ending it. I’m not going to but I can’t stop thinking about it. My life feels worthless. I don’t feel like I help anyone. Obviously we can’t see too much of our family right now but that wouldn’t matter because we don’t all get along. 

My dad re married when I was 14. They had another kid. Same exact birthday as mine although 17 years apart. She is the golden child. They even had a drive by birthday thing for her to sing happy birthday. I’m under 26. Don’t want to say my exact age. 

I get I’m older and I get the older you get birthdays kinda get less exciting. But I feel like dirt on the ground to people around me. I feel lonely and I feel sad I don’t feel excitement. 

Again it’s just another day but it feels shitty. Maybe it’s the memories I miss I don’t know. Just wanted to get it off my chest. 

I’m scared to wake up tomorrow. I’m scared to have another year like I just had. I don’t think I can survive it. I barely survived this one. 

This isn’t a “oh I hope Reddit wishes me happy bday for validation” post. I just feel like sometimes on here I can share and get it out there. I don’t really have an outlet.

1723,Should I kill myself? I am the most uninteresting person and I feel like I am the only one who puts effort into any of my relationships.,"I guess I'll tell you a bit about myself, since this really is a chance for me to rant.  I know the question sounds edgy, or attention seeking but I just can't get this thought out of my head.


Okay so I had a shitty childhood as lots of people had, mother was Schizophrenic, father was controlling and abusive.  It created a lot of stress for me as, I never got a chance to build friendships as a child.  I was too scared to bring people home and have them see what my family was like.  Also I was usually way poorer than the others in my area, so I would constantly be judged for what I had or how I'd dress.  Though thats not what's causing me stress now, I've somewhat moved past that phase.

My family became somewhat middle class, I live with my stepmom and dad in a new city when I was 13.  He isnt as bad anymore, but I hate living in this city.  As soon as I came here, I got bullied and pushed around.  Had to deal with being jumped and just insecurity.  Shortly before moving I started to find my group, and I had friends that I had a lot of fun with, even though most of the time was spent at their place, but after moving I couldn't find anyone I vibed with.  No one I can connect, everyone thought I was weird and out of place.  So I just focused on myself - I want to be a computer scientist someday do just focus on that.  Though there was always this sense of loneliness.  I am socially anxious, awkward, and have trouble meeting new people, but honestly on the inside, I am an extrovert.  I constantly crave social interaction, I want go spend most of my time with other people, like the only time I need alone time is to practice piano.  But even then its more fun with others around.

This loneliness just slowly made me sadder and sadder.  I slowly got more and more awkward and struggled more and more to reach out.  Once highschool started, I did make a small group, but it was honestly super toxic so I had to break free.  I couldnt deal with the constant threats and judgement.  I left hating myself though and feeling out of place and like a loser.  This went on for a while where I had one friend.  Untill the end of grade 11, I got to this point where I thought maybe I should just end it, and that was just what I thought every moment.  I was so close to doing it but these couple girls in my class started reaching out to me and pulling me along.  I didn't tell them anything of course but they would just joke around with me and one of them was super flirty though I didn't read it at the time.  I started to get to this happy high in my life, then I met a girl on a bus who sorta signaled for me to talk to her.

We ended up dating for almost 2 years.

Now one of the girls I met in class, I'll call her Angela, is a friend to this day.  Throughout grade 12 we spent everyday together, we would always be togrther at lunch, or between classes.  I met a lot of friends through her though, some of them I didnt vibe the best with.  A lot of them were suspicious that we were dating, and her guy friends got jealous of me.  So they started telling her I wasn't trustable and its sort of weird that we are so close even though I have girlfriend.  But, I just vibed better with girls I found.  She would rant to me, I would joke around with her, it was a fun friendship.  We didn't text at all though so once we weren't able to spend so much time together it got complicated.  I'll get back to Angela later.

My ex, the girl I dated from april grade 11, to december 2019, the end of my first semester of university.  I'll call her Kayla.  I have actually blocked of so much of my memory of her, like I remember maybe 3 or 4 moments over a year and 8 months or so of dating.  We started of pretty good, but I believe we were both immature and didn't know how to set boundaries or handle a relationship.  Which is what led to a lot of fighting.  I do remember we fought a bit around a year into the relationship because she kept cancelling plans with me to go out and play games.  Like I never tried to get in the way of her friendships, but she cancelled our anniversary date, and just a few other dates we set up literally the evening before or the morning of to hang out with friends.  I told her that I wanted her to hang out with friends but the constant cancelling plans with me and not trying to reschedule was hurtful.  Ahh, a lot of it is coming back now.  I would honestly say we were a bit codependent, she relied on me for emotional support as her mother was extremely controlling, I relied on her for my social needs.  Not a healthy relationship.  We ended up breaking up after growing a bit distant, and at the end she played a bunch of games with me.  Her mother didn't want me dating her which was the main reason we broke up.  So she told me if I can convince her mom, shed let me get back with her.  I didnt do this of course but I was distraught.  I felt like I had nothing.

I started playing piano in grade 11 but quit while we dated because of the effort it took.  Most of my time went towards school and her.  I ignored a lot of my friendships more than I should have during the relationship so I was in a terrible spot.  It made me realize how unhealthy a person I was.  I had struggles reaching out to the 3 friends or so I had because I always questioned whether they liked me.  But when we broke up, they were there for me.  Though I hated myself for opening up to them, showing the weak side of myself, showing my insecurity, and once again depending on others for emotional stability is so unhealthy and unattractive.  

I cried infront of them, I told them about how I suffered with suicidal thoughts, I told them about my past and what I went through and they listened to me.  I am grateful for that but I never should of told them a thing.  2020 happened and I began isolating myself, I attempted suicide once at the start.  I tried reaching out to Angela, I didn't want to tell any of them about my issues any more but I wanted to distract myself and have someone to chat to.  No response, the lack of effort I put in my friends finally came to haunt me.  Once I got over my ex in march 2020, no one wanted to talk to me anymore.  We weren't able to see eachother at school and I didn't build that relationship where we can just text.  We weren't able to hangout so the friendships sort of rotted.  I thought I was hopeless, friendless, and losing more prospects for the future.  I dont have connections to be successful.  I have nothing.  So I though why not end it.


I took a bunch of pills but I just ended up blacking out and puking a bunch.  I remember the feeling of blacking out but I could still hear the voice of people freaking out as I was fading.  I lost vision and feeling but I could still hear.  I thought I was dead.  But no I wasn't, I started therapy regularly.  I was so hopeless and didnt know how to make friends but I kept pushing through.  I tried reaching out a few times and sometimes they said hi back.  I ended up hanging out with Angela once restrictions lifted a bit in the summer.  But after that we struggled to talk again.  My other 2 friends ended up dating and stopped talking to most people becsuse of that.  

At the start of 2020 after the breakup, I started getting into philosophy actually and began focusing on including stoicism and other ways of being into my life.  Just accepting that things go wrong but thats okay.  Its very hard and I obviously have yet to achieve it but I wanted to learn to be happy even if I didn't have everything I want.  I began journaling what I did and didnt like about myself and tried to become a better person.

This awkard phase went on for a while, I would talk to my cousin for comfort.  We would call and game, though honestly, I lost interests in games.  I started craving to play the piano again and by 2021 I decided to get back into it.  I practice a lot and can play a couple chopin pieces, but I still am not very good so its not something I can like show off to people.  Also I became incredibly more awkward, in trying to better myself, I became super apologetic and passive.  I struggle to joke around because I don't want to offend, or I just feel awkward.  I never know what to say, and I am always trying to think like is this what a good person does.  

Which inches closer to today.  I struggle so hard with making friends, I don't have much interesting skills.  I don't have much hobbies besides piano, business, and like history.  I am not super funny.  I am awkwrd and uncomfortable with new people.  I am needy.  I am dependent on social interaction yet I get none.  I am not as good looking as I once was.  I feel so unattractive.  Like why would anyone want to be friends with me, and no matter how hard I try to get out there or be interesting, it seems I am always the one putting all of the effort to relationships.  I am the one chasing, and no one is giving me any thought.

I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april.  Its a ldr though, and her timezone is 14 hours ahead.  It was pure infatuation at the start, we both felt so confident about the relationship.  She had plans to move to the same city as me, we had so much in common.  We were both sort of shy and laid back.  Though as I got more comfortable my extroverted side came out.  I think I smoothered her too much though, I always complimented her and tried to tell her it'll be okay and I am eilling to wait for borders to lift to meet her.  She liked it so I kept doing it, but I think the repetitiveness, lack of physical touch, and my neediness eventually became unattractive.  It became the norm. I was always there for her when she needed to talk, and we kept talking about how we are going to meet as soon as borders go up.  It was hard to keep interesting and we didnt know what else to do.  Then in the last month, things started getting hard for me at work and in my family, I opened up about insecurities about my mom health as she was diagnosed with cancer, and how I feel I have to work on my confidence.  I think this must have really been a turn off.  She has become more and more distant this past month.  She still says shes into me but she doesn't talk about the future as much and is not nearly as affectionate as before.  She has said she doesn't know how much longer she can do ldr, but shes willing to keep trying a little longer for me.  But it feels like she isn't putting any effort and idk, the relationship doesnt feel secure and loving anymore.  I talked to her about it and she said she really likes me, but she feels so distant.  Idk what I can do to help this or if theres anything.  I really like her, like we never fought, and we really matched.  I loved gsming with her, or playing piano for her.  Not feeling uptight in this relationship like the last.  But yet it still feels like its coming to an end soon and I can't believe this is happening again.  I really want it to work but idk what to do.  I tried reaching out to friends more and making new friends but its more of me putting sll the effort.  No one is responsive.  Like I don't need to talk about my girlfriend or the relationship, I just want to distract myself and have people there so I feel cared for.  I am stuck in this spot I was in, in 2020 again.  I am about to be alone again.

I of course have not told my girlfriend about these thoughts, not her problem.  But like I feel like my life is going to be this cycle of me craving attention and chasing others away.  I cant live in this constant cycle.  Love isn't worth it, if it always ends in a break up.  I have no close friends so I am going to be alone.  Like am I just bound to suffer.  I don't even think I enjoy cs anymore, but it feels too late to go into music or business.  Plus I don't have the contacts for business.  My career feels hopeless, my relationships feel hopeless, and being more confident one day feels like a longshot.

So here I am thinking to myself, do I end it? 

Is it worth the continual suffering?

Is this relationship hopeless?

Will I find friends that I can connect with?

Will I become a better person?

Will I succeed?

I don't know, and at this point, it feels like I should give up.","Should I kill myself?

I ignored a lot of my friendships more than I should have during the relationship so I was in a terrible spot.  It made me realize how unhealthy a person I was.  I had struggles reaching out to the 3 friends or so I had because I always questioned whether they liked me.  But when we broke up, they were there for me.  Though I hated myself for opening up to them, showing the weak side of myself, showing my insecurity, and once again depending on others for emotional stability is so unhealthy and unattractive.  

I cried infront of them, I told them about how I suffered with suicidal thoughts, I told them about my past and what I went through and they listened to me.  I am grateful for that but I never should of told them a thing.  2020 happened and I began isolating myself, I attempted suicide once at the start.  I tried reaching out to Angela, I didn't want to tell any of them about my issues any more but I wanted to distract myself and have someone to chat to.  No response, the lack of effort I put in my friends finally came to haunt me.  Once I got over my ex in march 2020, no one wanted to talk to me anymore.  We weren't able to see eachother at school and I didn't build that relationship where we can just text.  We weren't able to hangout so the friendships sort of rotted.  I thought I was hopeless, friendless, and losing more prospects for the future.  I dont have connections to be successful.  I have nothing.  So I though why not end it.


I took a bunch of pills but I just ended up blacking out and puking a bunch.  I remember the feeling of blacking out but I could still hear the voice of people freaking out as I was fading.  I lost vision and feeling but I could still hear.  I thought I was dead.  But no I wasn't, I started therapy regularly.  I was so hopeless and didnt know how to make friends but I kept pushing through.  I tried reaching out a few times and sometimes they said hi back.  I ended up hanging out with Angela once restrictions lifted a bit in the summer.  But after that we struggled to talk again.  My other 2 friends ended up dating and stopped talking to most people becsuse of that.  

At the start of 2020 after the breakup, I started getting into philosophy actually and began focusing on including stoicism and other ways of being into my life.  Just accepting that things go wrong but thats okay.  Its very hard and I obviously have yet to achieve it but I wanted to learn to be happy even if I didn't have everything I want.  I began journaling what I did and didnt like about myself and tried to become a better person.

This awkard phase went on for a while, I would talk to my cousin for comfort.  We would call and game, though honestly, I lost interests in games.  I started craving to play the piano again and by 2021 I decided to get back into it.  I practice a lot and can play a couple chopin pieces, but I still am not very good so its not something I can like show off to people.  Also I became incredibly more awkward, in trying to better myself, I became super apologetic and passive.  I struggle to joke around because I don't want to offend, or I just feel awkward.  I never know what to say, and I am always trying to think like is this what a good person does.  

Which inches closer to today.  I struggle so hard with making friends, I don't have much interesting skills.  I don't have much hobbies besides piano, business, and like history.  I am not super funny.  I am awkwrd and uncomfortable with new people.  I am needy.  I am dependent on social interaction yet I get none.  I am not as good looking as I once was.  I feel so unattractive.  Like why would anyone want to be friends with me, and no matter how hard I try to get out there or be interesting, it seems I am always the one putting all of the effort to relationships.  I am the one chasing, and no one is giving me any thought.

I actually am in a relationship though, we started dating in april.  Its a ldr though, and her timezone is 14 hours ahead.  It was pure infatuation at the start, we both felt so confident about the relationship.  She had plans to move to the same city as me, we had so much in common.  We were both sort of shy and laid back.  Though as I got more comfortable my extroverted side came out.  I think I smoothered her too much though, I always complimented her and tried to tell her it'll be okay and I am eilling to wait for borders to lift to meet her.  She liked it so I kept doing it, but I think the repetitiveness, lack of physical touch, and my neediness eventually became unattractive.  It became the norm. I was always there for her when she needed to talk, and we kept talking about how we are going to meet as soon as borders go up.  It was hard to keep interesting and we didnt know what else to do.  Then in the last month, things started getting hard for me at work and in my family, I opened up about insecurities about my mom health as she was diagnosed with cancer, and how I feel I have to work on my confidence.  I think this must have really been a turn off.  She has become more and more distant this past month.  She still says shes into me but she doesn't talk about the future as much and is not nearly as affectionate as before.  She has said she doesn't know how much longer she can do ldr, but shes willing to keep trying a little longer for me.  But it feels like she isn't putting any effort and idk, the relationship doesnt feel secure and loving anymore.  I talked to her about it and she said she really likes me, but she feels so distant.  Idk what I can do to help this or if theres anything.  I really like her, like we never fought, and we really matched.  I loved gsming with her, or playing piano for her.  Not feeling uptight in this relationship like the last.  But yet it still feels like its coming to an end soon and I can't believe this is happening again.  I really want it to work but idk what to do.  I tried reaching out to friends more and making new friends but its more of me putting sll the effort.  No one is responsive.  Like I don't need to talk about my girlfriend or the relationship, I just want to distract myself and have people there so I feel cared for.  I am stuck in this spot I was in, in 2020 again.  I am about to be alone again.

I of course have not told my girlfriend about these thoughts, not her problem.  But like I feel like my life is going to be this cycle of me craving attention and chasing others away.  I cant live in this constant cycle.  Love isn't worth it, if it always ends in a break up.  I have no close friends so I am going to be alone.  Like am I just bound to suffer.  I don't even think I enjoy cs anymore, but it feels too late to go into music or business.  Plus I don't have the contacts for business.  My career feels hopeless, my relationships feel hopeless, and being more confident one day feels like a longshot.

So here I am thinking to myself, do I end it? 

Is it worth the continual suffering?

Is this relationship hopeless?

Will I find friends that I can connect with?

Will I become a better person?

Will I succeed?

I don't know, and at this point, it feels like I should give up.",bit ship son fee feel relationship ion interest sound question king head attention ion father bus people kay troll schizophrenic mother fat trolling child control childhood ship end eat friend friendship stress child car people home red family my_family poor area judge ged dress sing stress city class middle cam new live family my_family dad city hate living cam lie deal security art fun end time friend bed group star focus scientist day computer inside war people new_people honestly meeting new meet honest social ice people end social_interaction time practice action piano social ion fun war art school mall honestly super group free honest star high deal judge eat threat men left feeling fee feel end friend end poi men art class pull girl star joke time super bus art my_life life girl talk star high dating end year class end friend girl day classes class day lunch end friend jealous dating end friend art end trust friend girl star bed girl joke fun ship end friend friendship end time cat back end university girl my_ex kay memory dating year month men believe art ship mature lie set star relationship ion fight play bit ship plan year game relationship ion morning ship end friend evening friendship set end plan friend back support bit end honestly troll code mother lie trolling honest control social emotion ion alt health ship healthy relationship ion play bit end king game bun reason dating son mother back nothing art play piano star school war time ship end red friend friendship my_friend my_friends pot relationship ion alt health healthy son question end friend ion alt health end healthy ending hate show security emotion ion stability suicidal_thoughts list listen red suicidal art suicide star chat end cam friend response my_friend my_friends my_ex talk school ship relationship ion ship end friend friendship sing end friend hope future success ion nothing end black end king bun black ice people king voice feeling fee feel vision feeling fee feel ion dead art rap therapy star end friend hope back time bit end summer ion talk dating people talking end friend king talk art sing my_life philosophy life focus star kay son comfort talk honestly game honest interest art back play piano star play ice people practice show war cam red super joke war end fee feel ink son think day end friend king skill interest bus business tor story history piano fun funny super comfort people new_people new end social_interaction non action social ion king look fee feel ship end friend relationship ion interest sing art dating ship star relationship ion time head art ship fat star relationship ion sam city plan back comfort cam my_ex order red kay ink meet men think physical repetitive event cam ink pet think cam order talking king talk meet interest nose alt art health my_mom cancer month fee feel work family confidence tie my_family star ink think month talk future ion longer ship fee feel relationship ion fee talk feel help match play piano love ship feeling fee feel relationship ion believe end fee feel lie work end new_friends friend new king car people ship end red friend girl fee talk feel relationship ion pot end friend problem girl sing my_life life cycle fee feel attention ion cycle live end break_up love close_friends end friend bus business ink music fee feel think bus business car ship day career fee feel hope relationship ion end ink king thinking think ship hip_hop hope relationship ion end friend son poi fee feel,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]"

1819,I could really do with some kind words.,"So I just got off the phone with my GP. She's prescribing me Prozac. I've never been on psych meds before.

I'm 17 and have struggled with increasingly worse severe depression since I was 11. I'm undiagnosed as of now because I'm only this last 2 months seeking help for the first time (kind of a do-or-die situation.)

I'm from the UK and NHS mental health services are dire. My GP essentially told me that due to being 17 and a half years old, I'm too young for adult mental health services and too old to be referred to the adolescent services. She listened to me talk and on the spot said that I sound like I have PTSD (I honestly feel like I do as well, but  I'm not prepared to say I have it w/o formal diagnosis) which I feel was way too quickly to say something like that.

Basically the next half year i'll be monitored to make sure the Prozac doesn't finish me off, because in people of my age it can make suicidal feelings get worse.

I feel so lost. She said I can't see a psychiatrist or a clinic or anything until I'm 18, which is 7 months away, so I'm just put on meds and stuck waiting.

I feel such lack of support or urgency... I literally want to die and they're just like ""here's some pills, come back when you're 18.""

I don't know, maybe I'm complaining too much. I just felt like they were worryingly quick to give me meds and tick me off the list. I'm super overwhelmed right now, there wasn't even any talk of side affects or really what to expect, apart from ""by the way, these pills make you even more suicidal sometimes.""","I could really do with some kind words.So I just got off the phone with my GP.

73,Why do I even bother?,"I never get any replies on this subreddit, but here I am again prostrating myself to all who dare to read my post! I suffer from insomnia, migraines, chest pain, muscle pain, the list goes on and on. My body is a broken temple, and I am but nineteen years old, yet the doctors claim nothing is wrong with me. Not a day goes by when I don't consider suicide due to my physical maladies.

My physical maladies are only the start! After all, according to my Psychiatrist, I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and Autism. My father didn't want to raise me. I have a mother who berates me regularly and my step-father who is an anger-addict. I don't have any friends. I've had five jobs in the past 365 days, but none of them have worked out. Hell, I can't even figure out for gender identity or sexual orientation for crying out loud!

I know someone is going to tell me to go see a therapist and a doctor, but all I can say is that I do. It doesn't matter. I'm broken. I expect to die of esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, or some other such terminal disease. Life has lost all its meaning. I would rather be dead that going through all this suffering. And nobody seems to ever read my posts, and if they do, they write insulting replies. 

I am worse than Hitler and Stalin combined. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I'm going to take some medication to gain me three or four hours of sleep. I know nobody will read this, so who cares? Pizza! Pineapple! Carl Jung! Dead babies! Quantum Mechanics!

1469,How to get brave enough to kill yourself,"PLEASE NOTE I am not in any danger to myself at this time so no need for urgency. (TLDR; self hate, worthlessness, getting over fear of death.)  


  

I’m just so tired of living. 

I’ve always hated myself and people since a very early age and I cannot trust anyone. I feel absolutely wrong in this world. Everything I do or say or think is wrong. Since day one I was wrong. I can’t do anything right (like honestly not trying to exaggerate here) and can’t make any connections with anyone. I’m actually unable to feel love or compassion or any sort of human connection. (Don’t even get me started on sex) I’m sick of watching everyone else get what I can’t have. I don’t deserve love or kindness and I’m honestly sick of being the brunt of a very boring joke. I feel like the universe is constantly telling me I don’t belong here; I also feel like I’m not THAT important to have the universe specifically pick on me. My role in this world is to be unremarkable and useless. I only see evil in the world, I can see no kindness. As long as there is man (\*men), there can be on peace. Since the dawn of time we’ve chosen violence, death and hate. Even in the 21st century we still are starting wars, having genocides and famine and humans are becoming less and less human… (or more human??) I can’t hold onto friendships or make any solid connections. I can only make friend with people who need someone’s shoulder to cry on and once they’re done with me, they’re gone. I also cling onto anyone that stays remotely too long and then feel utterly betrayed by the smallest problem they face me with. I freak out at the smallest things like dropping a spoon or having a giant mess. I used to be able to pretend to be happy and healthy and human but, as usual, I can’t do that right so I’m slipping. 

I can’t stay at a job for longer than a year without freaking out. I work at a job I’ve wanted for so long but see how little work or care is actually put in by my fellow coworkers and its maddening. They say we’re a team and all here for each other, but threaten my job when I have a bad mental health day and couldn’t care less (or only pretend to care so they get goss) I have the most amazing best friend but I do not deserve to be friends with them. They’re the only person to make me feel almost heard and accepted, sticking through all the real bad times, but I know they’re too good for me and its only a matter of time before I push them away with my bullshit. I’m constantly talking about killing myself but I’m too much of a fucking pussy to do it. I only have myself in this world and that absolutely the worst possible thing I can have. For as much hate as I have for other people, I have just a tiny bit more for myself. The only person to ever love me is dead, and even then I wasn’t enough for them. (Can argue their lives would’ve been well worth more without my birth) I’m just constantly fighting with myself and the demons in my head and I’m just s sick of feeling like this. I have no family, no kids, no property and barely enough money to keep me afloat. I’m usually an organized person but my place has hit a new level of depression and I’m sick of looking at it all but too lazy to clean up. I’m anxious 24/7. I’m so sick of being ungrateful and a fucking spoiled 1st world valley girl who’s never had hardships. I have no hope that I’ll ever get better. I feel like I want to be miserable. I have so much passion and it goes unheard or unwanted and I’m watching the world literally falling apart and no one gives a flying fuck. The planet is dying and people only care about going to parties and being stupid cunts who then mindlessly breed and treat their kids as toys. Everyone is just getting more narcissistic and its honestly terrifying. Especially seeing how the world responded to Covid (Mostly the US) and watching everyone bitch and moan how they can’t go out or get haircuts while THOUSDANDS of people are dying is just so fucking disgusting. Humans have outstayed their welcome &amp; I honestly cant wait for the end of the human race. 

I have no interest in anything anymore and even if I did, like drawing, I immediately remind myself how pointless it is. I’ve been drawing for a good chunk of my life and seeing children so far ahead of me in development and skill just makes me realize how I’ve wasted my time on something so trivial. I have no messages or any grand ideas to out into the world. No one wants to see shit from a dumb ass white girl from LA. (Well, a dumb ass ugly white girl) I love animals but can’t take care of them for shit &amp; I feel like I’m always failing them. Humans do nothing but slay and enslave animals and we don’t care how many have to go extinct as long as we get fancy things. I’m taking up way too much space and resources. I could be happy and free by now; sell all my shit and travel the world before kicking the bucket but instead I choose to run the rat race, get that tiny slice of bread and do what every other human does. I’m too scared to do it (but getting closer I think!!) so this is what I deserve. I have shit planned like trusts/wills and how I’d do it but I don’t deserve peace. I can’t even say really why I’m coming to the internet for advice when I know exactly how it’ll turn out. (Get maybe a few replies, mostly being trolls and the rest being a generic ‘it’ll get better!’ crap) I feel just wrong in this person suit that was not tailor made for me and there’s no way of getting out except death. So I guess just any advice on how to better deal with being a worthless loser, how to hold up that smile so you don’t make anyone else uncomfortable (Or just changing yourself completely) and how to ultimately gain confidence to fucking do what I’ve wanted since middle school.","How to get brave enough to kill yourselfPLEASE NOTE I am not in any danger to myself at this time so no need for urgency.

1263,I’m lost,"Suicide thoughts

First of all , I wanna say sorry for my bad English.I didn't go to psychiatrist , but I'm pretty sure I have depression for 4 years . Back then I just felt like I lost all my positive emotions (for no reason) all of suden and I told it to friends and family and everybody was like : It's normal, it happens , it will disappeared...I cannot feel almost anything, when someone close to me die, I can't cry , when something good happens ,I can't smile (sometimes (but very rare) I can feel euphoria ) . I had no motivation and hope for better future then, and now is same .I have little health problems for 5 years ,and I can't even force my self to go to doctor because I'm affraid of diagnosis, and things are worse now. People think I'm doing a little bit better then earlier because I passed my entrance examination for college one month ago(last year all my friends did it, I decided to make a one year break ) . But college don't change anything.I 'm still big pesimits and can't feel anything. Actually I can feel fear. I have very strong social anxiety. I have 5 very close friends , they are like brothers to me and I'm relaxed when I'm with them , but when I talk to girls , I'm totally confused. They even can't understand what I'm saying because I don't open my mouth enough and speak very quiet ... I never had a girlfriend... Let's go back to social anxiety.It's very hard to go to for example market because I'm overthinking what if someone asks me something, ... I have very good relationship with mother, not good but no bad relationship with sister , and very bad relationship with father (it's almost hate) . I also have very often mood changings and I also take decisions very hard because I don't know what I want , and even when I take a decision, I change it very quick . I like watching soccer and basketball but it's hard to concentrate to watching because my mind flyes somewhere... I can't find purpose of life.

537,Girlfriend with depression pushes me away,"Hello,
Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a few months now and everything was going good. I could see her love and smile and she was constantly there to either do something or help me. Now I know she had a history of selfharm and depression and I'm not one to change her for what she feels, because I know that's almost impossible in the case of depression. Still I told her that I'm there for here whenever she's in need. 
Yet ever since a week or two ago she started pushing me away and started to cut herself again. Before we started the relationship she told me she would probably push me away and said that she didn't mean for it to happen and was sorry if she would hurt me in any way. To be honest I didn't really think it would be this bad, but that's not the thing that hurts me the most. Personally, as a loved one, I think that seeing your loved one slowly fade away is the most painful part. It feels as if someone took over her body. 
I talked to her about it and I know she still cares about me, because she doesn't want me to feel bad. I told her that I would manage and that I would always be there for here and love her no matter what, but I don't know if I did the right thing or not and would like some advice in how to help her get through this phase. 
Lots of love and respect for all those who deal with this.","Girlfriend with depression pushes me awayHello,

Still I told her that I'm there for here whenever she's in need. 
Yet ever since a week or two ago she started pushing me away and started to cut herself again. Before we started the relationship she told me she would probably push me away and said that she didn't mean for it to happen and was sorry if she would hurt me in any way. To be honest I didn't really think it would be this bad, but that's not the thing that hurts me the most. Personally, as a loved one, I think that seeing your loved one slowly fade away is the most painful part. It feels as if someone took over her body. 
I talked to her about it and I know she still cares about me, because she doesn't want me to feel bad. I told her that I would manage and that I would always be there for here and love her no matter what, but I don't know if I did the right thing or not and would like some advice in how to help her get through this phase. 
Lots of love and respect for all those who deal with this.",dating end friend hell depression month girl press ion smile help love tor story possible depression history fee press feel arm case change ion art cut week star art ship star relationship ion ink honest think art ink son pain love think personal body fee feel car fee talk feel ice age right help man love advice deal respect love,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]"

1714,I'm a failure in life,"I'm 19 years old. I don't go to college nor do i have a job. I am socially inept, extremely depressed and I live in an incredbily abusive household. My mother will go from loving me to telling me to kill myself and that I ruined her life. Just the other day she said she is gonna kill herself if i don't stop talking back. I live with my molester grandfather.

My dad left me with said molester and told me to just get over the sexual abuse and move on with life. I started talking with some guy online and being intimate but he hasn't been talking to me all day. 

Just yesterday my mother was complaing about how I'm gonna start college late and how fucking embarassing it will be. She basically instilled more anxiety telling me how I'm gonna envy everyone my age because while they're gonna get their associates, i'm gonna be a loser several years behind, struggling. I told her I wasn't even thinking that negative until she brought it up. Then she threw a fucking bitch fit and started saying ""Oh I get it. I'm the main problem in your life. Maybe I should just go and die. God damn I can never say anything to you without you getting upset and hurt!""

The my molester grandfather came inside my room to 'clean my floors' and i told him to leave me alone but he wouldn't becuase my floors were 'too dirty' and that i don't do anything all day.

Give me one fucking reason why i shouldnt just slit my own fucking throat.","I'm a failure in lifeI'm 19 years old. I don't go to college nor do i have a job.

251,F 15 struggling with depression and feeling hopeless. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Any advice?,"Hello Reddit. for a little backstory, I'm 15 years old and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety just over two years ago. It has definitely gotten worse sense then, and I have not talked to a counselor since. Last November, I dropped out of my high school to begin home schooling with a tutor due to social anxiety and my depression hitting a low point. Though I enjoy the environment and freedom that comes with home schooling much better, it does get very lonely. The only people I talk to now are my long distance boyfriend, a couple online friends, and my family (who are very busy with their own work and school) Along with my family being busy, I hardly ever mention my depression to them. If I do, I feel like I'm wasting their time and they'll be disappointed in me. My depression has gotten increasingly worse over the past few months. I've always been skinny, but I've lost a significant amount of weight to the point it's unhealthy. I have no appetite, no desire to do anything, and no one to talk to. With the start of summer, my day consists of laying around and watching TV or playing video games. Even if plans do come up, physical symptoms of anxiety like panic attacks, head aches, and stomach aches typically prevent me from going. My boyfriend wants me to see a counselor, But I'm hesitant because the one I had previously didn't help much, and was very expensive. I worry that by asking my parent's for help, (with my anxiety, depression, and poor eating habits) I'll be wasting their money and time. At the same time, I'm afraid that if I continue to sit here and do nothing I won't live to see my 16th birthday. What should I do? Any tips on getting help and finding meaning and motivation in life at a young age?","F 15 struggling with depression and feeling hopeless. I feel like I have no one to talk to.

1130,I don't know what else to title this... depressed 🤷‍♀️,"Just got off the phone with my mom. She said I sounded insane. At first I was talking a mile a minute, then I was crying, then angry. 
I feel out of wack. 

I've had depression before but covid is definitely making it way worse. I'm a substitute teacher/recent graduate. I don't have any jobs because teachers have been online where I am so I currently have zero income. I can barely afford to live. I don't have any good friends. My 2 best friends live in another city and they tend to screen my calls. Just out of a selfish lack of desire to talk to me. They have boyfriends and babies so they don't need me like I need them. 
I've been so lonely. 
I was dumped back in November. Thought about dating again over Christmas. Met someone nice but I'm so bipolar (maybe clinically, I've had my suspicions) right now that I'm not even a healthy person to date. One second I'm seizing the day, full face of makeup, exercising and ready for a date, the next second I'm canceling, crying, laying in bed watching movies and hating myself like an empty shell. 

Before you say get therapy or look into being diagnosed with bipolar, the reason I don't is 1. Can't afford therapy and 2. Because of everything with covid, being dumped, having no income, having no friends, I truly do think this could just be a situational depression with manic tendencies due to boredom. 
I don't know what to do though. 
My mom said ""go date to make friends"" - that's not how dating works. Then she told me to move home, well I don't wanna be stuck with my family like a 25 year old loser. I just wish my life was better, I want to be living it instead of crying. 

Could use some support or advice or even just be listened to since noone else does. 
Thank you","I don't know what else to title this... depressed 🤷‍♀️Just got off the phone with my mom. She said I sounded insane. At first I was talking a mile a minute, then I was crying, then angry.

136,Nightmares are making my life a living hell,"I’ve been having dreams that feel like they last multiple days, despite me being asleep for only a few hours at a time.  It’s extremely disorienting to wake up from these. Sometimes it’s relatively normal stuff happening in the dream, but others it’s not. It’s rare for me to sleep without having a dream that feels like at least two days pass, even if it was just a short nap in real time. 

The worst of these, which has repeated itself several times, involves me being trapped in a makeshift prison camp and used as a slave for manual labor. This particular dream spanned a little more than two weeks the first time I experienced it. I remember some of my fellow prisoners and trying to make friends with them, before being beaten and told not to speak to anyone. About I week in, I often start planning an escape attempt. It’s worked twice, but when it fails, the prison guards kill me, and anyone else who tried to escape with me. On the two occasions where I did escape I was the only one to do so. I run home, to find the furniture rearranged and the walls in different places. I beg my roommate for help and he’s confused, saying I’ve been gone less than an hour. I’m pursued by the prison guards, who for whatever reason are Russian and are experts at tracking people down without raising suspicion. I’ve resorted to killing one of them in one of these dreams, and then it turned out he was just a normal person and not actually there to kidnap me. The “normal” police then arrested me and I went through an interrogation where the police concluded I was insane, then dropped me in an asylum.

It legitimately feels like I’m experiencing multiple days or weeks of time in these dreams.  I don’t know what’s going on. My own mind is holding me hostage. I’ve been dealing with depression for about three years now, and it’s gradually gotten worse over time, but the dreams are a relatively new addition to my daily torments and I don’t know how to deal with them.","Nightmares are making my life a living hellI’ve been having dreams that feel like they last multiple days, despite me being asleep for only a few hours at a time.

838,Today is my birthday.,"Today is my 16th birthday. I am all alone, i have no one to spend it with. No one even remember my birthday, no one said it either. I have been contemplating suicide and jave been looking forward to today in hopes that something would change. But nothing did. And if on mt special day nothing changes, then will anything ever really change? I decided no, and I made my final decision on whether or not i should follow through with whats been on my mind. And i decided I will. There is no point, I'm not happy and im always alone. This is my goodbye. I am posting this in the hopes that maybe someone will care. In the hopes that maybe someone will try to stop me, but I dont think that's what will happen. No body seems to really care about me these days. I'm just another guy on the street to everyone. This will probably get buried but oh well..

123,"My friend says she's depressed but doesn't ""seem"" so and it triggers me","Hello, I've struggled with depression (diagnosed) until last year, so I'm pretty familiar with the topic and mental health in general, which is why I suggested my friend, who was having some problems at school and some angry issues, to talk about it with our school counselor. She went there twice and she's now convinced that she has depression, I didn't say anything because I don't want to invalidate her feeling but honestly I don't think so (but again, i'm not the one who should say it). First of all, she told me the counselor didn't mention it, but made her understand it in a subtle way. Also, she doesn't exhibit any signs of depression, she doesn't have a lack of interest in doing things, or a change in appetite. I feel very bad writing this, I know every depression is different, but she has no problems going through the day, and it's always the one to ask to hang out for example, while I couldn't (and sometimes still can't) get out of bed in the morning, let alone function properly. 

All of this makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, every time she talks about it with idk what to say because I can't really empathize with her. She also mentions it a lot, which makes me even more uncomfortable, like the other time she was like ""oh, we are both depressed, what a great couple!"" and I was like wtf, first of all I'm not depressed, and then I know it may be a way to cope with it but it sounded really bad.","My friend says she's depressed but doesn't ""seem"" so and it triggers meHello, I've struggled with depression (diagnosed) until last year, so I'm pretty familiar with the topic and mental health in general, which is why I suggested my friend, who was having some problems at school and some angry issues, to talk about it with our school counselor.

I feel like this post is such a cry for help just screaming “someone teach me how to be a functioning human” lol but like. I just feel like because I’m depressed I take so long getting ready in the mornings, I move so slow and have so many things to do. So sometimes I just avoid getting ready and it’s honestly gross. 
but ok do you guys workout and then get ready for the day? Or do you get fully ready and then be productive and then just wipe off makeup and go workout then go the rest of the night without makeup? Do you brush your teeth before or after coffee? Is wet hair more acceptable than greasy hair? 
I want to start wearing minimal make up because when I do take the full two hours to get ready and make breakfast I feel so beautiful.

1864,College student wondering if checking myself in to a hospital would be the best option— any advice? What was it like/how much did it cost financially?,"Hi everyone, hoping I can get some advice on what to do in the next couple days.

I’ve been seriously thinking of killing myself for about four/five months (definitely had suicidal thoughts before that for many many years, but I didn’t start thinking it though or planning anything out until now). I’m starting to finally feel like I’m reaching the end, lol. 

I genuinely believe that I do not have the capacity to harm myself in any way, significantly or even slightly. So I kind of feel like I’d be lying when I tell them I have “intent” that’s more than just thoughts, although I do have many plans I’m hoping I can go through with when I’ve finally reached my limit (so I’m afraid they won’t admit me anyways). I’m trying to weigh the pros/cons of trying to get myself admitted and so far I’ve only been able to come up with cons:

My worries/concerns:

* I have no idea how much a stay or checking myself in would cost. I believe that this worrying would leave me off a lot worse than I am now.

* I’d also be worrying about what my friends/family are thinking while I’m gone and how I'm just causing them unnecessary stress (it'd be a shock for them as they don't know any of this)

* I’d also be worrying about missing my classes/assignments/a midterm and how I would catch up afterward

* I feel like I’d be generally miserable for however long I’m there

* I think it might make me miserable enough to actually commit suicide after I leave, although 

I feel like I wouldn’t be able to effectively kill myself and then would have to go through the whole process of hospitalization over again.
I just don’t see that many pro’s in checking myself in, but I don’t really know what else to do. Could anyone who’s gone through the process give some guidance?

Thank you.","College student wondering if checking myself in to a hospital would be the best option— any advice? What was it like/how much did it cost financially?Hi everyone, hoping I can get some advice on what to do in the next couple days.

93,I completely lost myself.,"Hello everybody. I am 17 years old. When i was 15 i knew exactly what to do in life, i had a passion, an ambition and goal. I worked towards it. But then suddenly when i hit 16, a complete shredding of my character happend. I lost interest in the things i loved to do, no goals in life, nothing!!!. I am ZERO. I have no desire also!. How can this happen? 

I have a really important examination coming up that can open a new door for the course of my life but right now my mind and heart is blank, no desire, no drive.. what the hell am i gonna do ?

I really miss my old self, the one who is hardworking and determined. I really need that guy back. I am so lost. I turned self-destructive. I smoke alot, i drink.. the most heart-wrenching thing is to see my mother so dissapointed with me.

1202,Depression and anxiety in cross cultural relationships?,"Year round I contend with anxiety and depression, successfully medicated for around 10 years now. Each winter I battle SAD in the form of depression and anxiety, and all the fun ways in which those can manifest themselves. Work interactions and personal relationships in particular suffer; my closest friends either seem not to notice or just cut me a load of slack, for which I’m grateful!

This past summer I began dating someone who lives in another part of the US and grew up in the Philippines. As December rolled into January I explained how this time of year often affects me and I expect even more so by working strictly from home. I also reminded her that I take prescription meds. Her response is that Americans are weak and we should just get our and walk plus spend time with others, as no one in her home country ever has to take medication.

That kind of sounds like bullshit in general, and also felt very insensitive for her to have said. Is it typical for other cultures to regard Americans in such a way regarding mental illness?","Depression and anxiety in cross cultural relationships?Year round I contend with anxiety and depression, successfully medicated for around 10 years now.

191,Need advice o how to help my SO who is suffering with depression. Sorry if it's not the right place to put this.,"My SO is suffering with depression and anxiety and is refusing to get help. It's almost like he just doesn't want to. In fact he has said on multiple occasions that he doesn't want to get better. 

It all started when we had a termination for many different health reasons on my part. That was a good 6 months ago now. I went straight back to work afterward and he just didn't. 

All he is doing is burying his head in video games, he doesn't leave the house, doesn't help around the house or anything. We have been trying to get him to see someone and he just flat out refuses. He self medicates as well and I don't think that is helping at all, in fact I think it maybe contributing to the problem. But anytime anyone brings it up he just says that it isn't a problem. 

He did start to take some antidepressants but has decided that he isn't going to take them anymore. I know we cant force him to get help but he needs to do something. 

I have been trying to support him by giving him space and letting him do his own thing, but that just doesn't seem to be working. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I am scared to bring any of this up to him as he just gets very defensive and nasty towards me (just to clarify it's not physical it's just hurtful).

295,"I just want to quit everything and say @&amp;*% it, need advice","Long story 

20yo, 3rd year in college and having a very rough patch. I was one of those “gifted” kids that never studied which started biting me in the butt once I got to IB high school. Got burnt out before I even got to college. Had issues with depression in high school as well. 

Fast forward to today and this semester isn’t even half way over and I’m pretty sure I’m going to fail 4/6 of my classes, I have no motivation to do anything nor can I make myself care about not failing exams. I would hate the professors but I just feel too exhausted to give a crap about them. Half the time I don’t show up to classes, even the ones I liked at the beginning of the semester, and when I do show up I’m sitting staring at a wall or rewatching a dumb video on reddit or instagram or whatever. 

I’ve regularly had suicidal thoughts since high school about jumping off a parking garage or crashing my car but I know I’ll never do it because of my family and my pet and responsibilities or whatever. 

I know I need to work at it and all but I can’t seem to find the “light at the end of the tunnel”. I can feel anxious about failing a class but I can’t bring myself to really care about it. My best friend says I’m just burnt out and my therapist is considering medication. I just don’t know what to do or how to get past just pushing through and get to “living for myself”. Not sure if this all made sense. 

TLDR: lack of motivation doesn’t even come close to describing how I feel about life. Not sure if medication helps this or not and could use some advice in general on how to get through depressive episodes.","I just want to quit everything and say @&amp;*% it, need adviceLong story

1936,I'm so close to giving up,"I'm so close to giving up on everything. For the last two weeks my mind has been in shit because someone I cared about betrayed me. They did something which could ruin my life and has given me severe trust issues for the foreseeable future.

Because of this I've started losing interest in every I used to enjoy. I used to love going to training but I'm beginning to think what's the point. As well my mind is starting to become self destructive. So many times these last 2 weeks, I haven't been able to look at myself in a mirror without saying something I hate about myself. It's brought me so close to the edge of hurting myself and I'm beginning to lose it.

I just want to have some I can trust and care about. But I'm getting so paranoid that everyone I like and know just hates me. It's gotten to the stage where im talking to people I like, and I'm over analyzing everything they say, thinking theyre just saying it out of pity for me. I just want someone, anyone to care about me. But I know no one ever will. I'm starting to think that there's no point in existing since no one would miss me if I'm gone. I feel I'm just annoying everyone I talk to and I'm just a burden on everyone.","I'm so close to giving upI'm so close to giving up on everything.

1269,Can missing morning erections be caused by depression?,"I understand that depression can lead to loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. But nowhere I find information whether missing nocturnal / morning erections can be caused by depression as well. And I'm not talking about a missing erection once in a while, but total lack of it every day for months.

In my limited understanding, morning erections are a pretty much biological thing, which can't be influenced by bad mood or thoughts, so I would assume a depression couldn't impact the presence of these erections.

I know about the side effects of antidepressants, but here I am just trying to find out whether regular, untreated depression can cause this lack of nocturnal / morning erections.

I feel like I sleep well enough, so missing REM phases is probably unlikely.

Any input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Can missing morning erections be caused by depression?I understand that depression can lead to loss of libido and erectile dysfunction.

1257,I feel lost,"I won't bore you with my sob story of a past, it was horrible and has left me a mental mess at the best of times. I was getting better, was motivated to keep going in every aspect of life and wanted to make my future mean more than just getting to the next day alive, and that's exactly what was happening. I had everything ahead of me, but all that has changed and disappeared.

I'm a 20 year old who's still living with their parents because I don't make enough to afford a place to live. I'm an aspiring writer who's dream is to be published, but who gets little to no good feedback from what I do. I'm an abuse survivor who continues to be abused and used at every turn, and in every way. I'm a trans who finds very little if any enjoyment from my own body. I have two friends, one is my girlfriend who lives in another country, and the other is moving away from me in a month. Family doesn't want me, and those who do want a better version of me. I work five days a week, and have very little time to get out of the house.

My life is a cycle of abandonment, and false promises. I have a hard time trusting others, and a harder time trusting myself. I've been suicidal before, and I'm passed that, I'm to the point where I don't even want to put in the effort to attempt it. Everything I do in life is just leading to another dead end.

1002,How to deal with the cyclical triad of draining symptoms,"Over the past months my depression has progressively become more disruptive. I’m now to the point where I’m stuck in a cycle of anxiety during the day, insomnia at night, and anhedonia all throughout the day.

Outside of increasing my SSRI dose with my doc, how can I overcome this if I can’t find therapy right now due to pandemic?

Much of my depression I feel comes from loneliness. I’m a man in my late 20s and I’ve never had a true best friend or romantic partner. I hoped this year would be that year because I found a job in a city I wanted to live, and it felt like a chance at renewed life. I accepted before the shutdown, and started after restrictions were in place, so I’ve spent the entire year alone in a new city as all social avenues were cut off. I almost have no socialization with coworkers either due to working remotely. I tried online dating, but that made things worse as I didn’t match with anyone and sent me on a self-doubting downward spiral. I just want to find someone that I can share a true connection with, but I don’t think that opportunity will come for a long time.","How to deal with the cyclical triad of draining symptomsOver the past months my depression has progressively become more disruptive.

187,Real Down,"I’ve been feeling really really down lately to the extent where I just don’t want to do anything but curl up in bed or be absolutely alone. Im mentally and emotionally tired. 

I just started a new job doing something I thought I would be happy doing. I had plans, I had a goal. 2 weeks into it and everything seems to be falling apart. I realised I’m utterly unhappy with what I’m doing and the place I’m doing it. I left my previous job (though the work life was simpler there) and rushed into this new job because I was stagnant there; going nowhere in the company and pay.

I’ve never been able to hold a job for long (3 years the most) and I’m always unhappy with the job. I do know there are other jobs out there which I could be better in but never took the risk fearing the low pay (starting from bottom) as I have plenty of commitments. I fear starting afresh


My wife has been the main financial support in the family and she’s doing way better than me. However the saddest thing I found out recently was that she is also very stressed out and unhappy with her job. The only reason why she is staying on is because I am not financially stable. My wife is such a wonderful woman and she doesn’t deserve this. 

In summary: I’m 31, not getting any younger, not going anywhere in life, in debt, no savings,  unhappy my job, unhappy with myself, a burden.

158,nothing left," 

(for background information: i'm in my mid 20s, and i live at home with my moms and my brother, and i've been dealing with depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder.)

i don't feel like there's any reasons left for me to hang on to life.nothing to look forward to.i don't even know what i'm looking for by posting this.

but, i can't even figure out how to word a paragraph for it.and i'm only good at making lists, so.here's everything i have the mind to allot right now.

* i can't move away because 1) i am financially entangled (split car payments, and rent that the house relies on, etc) and 2) my mom has repeatedly stated she'd go crazy living with just the other 2.
* no one wants to hire me, so i'm stuck at a job that overwhelms me so much it gives me daily anxiety attacks; i cry out of frustration or stress generally once or twice a day. some days are better than others. some days are worse.
* i'm afraid to talk to my (initially caring) managers about it because i feel like, after my previous health problems and missed work, they either don't believe me, or they're tired of me.
* i just came back from 2 weeks of unpaid medical leave because of a kidney stone. i haven't gotten the bill yet, but who knows if i can even pay it?
* i suffer from anorexia nervosa, but i can never seem to get a handle on it; i've relapsed several times over the past 3 years.
* everyone forgets about me. people stop talking to me mid-conversation. sometimes, my family forgets about me entirely, even when they're going out together or getting/making dinner (which is an Everyone thing in our house.) they forget my birthday.
* no one wants to date me--but, i understand it sort of. (i'm quiet, boring, and sad.) people i catch feelings for either reject me outright or just stop talking to me. someone i've known for 8 years (and dated 4 times) suddenly cut contact with me after not talking for months. the person i've been saying 'i love you' to for the past 1.5 years doesn't even want to be in an actual relationship to me. it all just feels like sweet but empty words.
* one mom is on disability, and my older brother doesn't have a job--he just picks up ""gigs"" maybe once a month. my other mom just quit her job on the spot two days ago, and has just been sitting around watching TV. i'm the only one in the house with a stable job. so, i can't quit.
* my health has never been the best, and i'm honestly just waiting to see when it finally tanks. part of me hopes it's terminal.
* i can't even afford a therapist that i desperately (obviously) need. i know i can talk to my friends, but i don't want to burden them when they already have a lot on their plates. no one wants to talk to somebody that's always bringing up negative or heavy topics. i don't want them to leave me too.
* not even online friends talk to me very much. i'm just kind of Here.
* i'm pretty convinced that the only romantic, lasting relationship i'll ever have is with imaginary characters in a dating sim game. now i can barely play anything with a romance plot because i'll just make myself sad.

i almost went through with it on christmas eve.the only reason i didn't was to keep from ruining christmas for my family.sometimes i wish i did it anyway.

tl;dr i feel trapped and alone in everything, and i feel like it's drowning me, and i want to let it.

1861,"I'm done,","Oi, im Ron a 17 year living in brazil attending the 2° grade in high school and I've reached a point in my life where I want to give up everything. 
Imma introvert teen with no friends, broke, weird and useless 
So i will try to explain exactly my situation 
Everyday i go to school and i see the girl i like with someone better than me i wonder wtf its wrong with me and why i can't have any type of relationship, i spent 3 months talking to this girl until she tell me she only see me as a friend. And that's not the first time 
In my life I've been close with 3 girls which I've really come close to relating to have something 
And they always tell me dat... 
Even though they say they want to be my friends they actually become people i used to know 
And when the thing is having friendships thats just something I don't have I see everybody having a group of friends hanging out having fun while all i have is nothing
About my family and financial situation is even worst 
I've been 3 weeks out the school working illegally 8 hours before i get fired (probably i got scammed and at this point i dont have nothing else to do) at some day i look myself at mirror and start wondering why i was live in such a situation it ain't right for a teen be living like that i was dreaming with school dreaming with study and when classes are over I go out with friends to eat something smoke cigrettes talk about life, dreaming with a date and stuff. 
But now im back to school and i feel like a zombie there
In this week im moving to a smaller house cuz my mom can't afford the place i am rn and all this stuff make me hate my country, and yeah the thing i most hate in this life it's this country i could be having a better life in anyplace and maybe its not worth immigrate somewhere by my shit nationality 
And about my physical situation i can say im handsome even though being very skinny and hating my body, all i wish was eating 5 times per day for gain weight and i can even start in gym cuz i can't pay for that 
So basically all This shit made me lose the will to live. Every day i think about killing myself. All i want its a real reason to live and to be happy
All i want it's live and not survive","I'm done,Oi, im Ron a 17 year living in brazil attending the 2° grade in high school and I've reached a point in my life where I want to give up everything.

we've never had any major fights/disagreements until this ""confrontation"" happened on thanksgiving day. he has been studying abroad in europe for the semester, and it's definitely taken a toll on him-- he knows and admits that this is one of the major reasons he is feeling the way he is now. he's homesick, doesn't have any close friends, and has recently found out one of his best friends from high school is addicted to drugs. overall.... it's been a really crazy semester for him, and lots of shitty things happening in my personal life as well. it's just not a good year for either of us, but our relationship has been really strong. 

i had just booked a non-refundable flight to visit him for christmas, my birthday, and through to new years. i noticed that, compared to when we discussed this visit during our last time together (\~1st week of november), he was significantly less excited. i knew something was off, but he wouldn't say. this weird vibe kept persisting through the week, and on thanksgiving night, i asked him what was wrong. he finally admitted to me (paraphrasing):

""i don't think i can love you anymore. not because i love someone else or lost interest in you, but i'm feeling really depressed recently, and i can't enjoy things. i can't even be excited for your visit. now, i'm just needing a break. I’m not saying I wanna cut you off completely, but at this moment idk how to even talk to you. what I’m doing is not giving up, but cleaning myself up. i just need time."" he keeps saying things like this, which is hard for me to accept because I know what it's like to be depressed. he is pushing me away and hiding this part of himself from me, and I just want nothing more than to support him and be there for him-- which made me feel like my visit was even more urgent.

he kept saying things like how he would feel sorry for me if i tried to stay by his side and support him, and how he doesn't want to burden me with his problems or ruin my bday/christmas/new years by making me sad. he even said, verbatim ""The more you care about me, the more I feel bad for you, regardless of what you’re saying. I might change my mind later but for now I can’t. When I see you care about me, I get hurt."" he even offered to pay for my flight because I ""shouldn't just come there to take care of someone who's full of shit"" since I can't get a refund, but I refused. 

It's been about two days, and at the end of our messaging and phone calls, I told him that I am still going to catch that flight, and that I'll give him the space he's asking for, but that I'm here whenever he needs me. 

sorry if it's hard to read, and no tl;dr because I think it's important to know everything that I wrote above before saying anything...

I'm just really desperate to talk to someone about this, and I really do need advice/support. 

How can I support him, aside from giving him space? Should I wait for him to reach out to me on his own terms, even if it means not seeing him at all for the 2 weeks I'm in the same city as him? How do I keep him from drifting away or getting worse, even with the distance?","my LDR boyfriend admitted he has depression and wants a break because of itfor context, my boyfriend and I are in an ldr for over 1.5 years now. he's from japan and i'm from america. depression/mental illness are very much taboo, as is even things like therapy, in japan. it's just not something that's socially acceptable to even talk about there, so i can't imagine how hard it must be for him now.

I can't pretend to be happy when I just had a terrible experience.

So... I don't know what to do. Lol! I even imagined sharing them my experience in the future, and hopefully they would understand and I could perhaps recreate a friendship? Lol. But when it's people from your past ... you can't help but associate them with the past.

671,I don't know how to deal with this anymore.,"Since I could remember I've always been off emotionally, I've tried therapy, and medications it never helped. I should probably give context but, I am just lonely to the point where I feel like nobody gives a shit if I'm alive or dead, even though I know I have people that care. I get really kind of ""crazy"" if you will, when I'm having a depressive episode. When it gets really bad I isolate myself from everyone around me, and it usually helps calm me down if I'm getting to manic. This would work when I had school and saw people, I was able to sort of have a connection to the outside world, then I'd go home and not talk to anyone and just listen to music and exist. Now that we have a self-quatantine all day I'm just alone, and when I have these episodes I have no one to turn to. Even to my closest friends I feel like a burden, and I don't want them to worry, I'm aware at how cliche I am. The last few days have been really hard, and I just don't know how much of this I can take while being alone. I just feel very panicky, alone, empty and depressed, and usually my ""episodes"" don't last several days, but this one is, and I don't know how to deal with it now. My only coping mechanism doesn't work anymore since I can't go to school then isolate myself. And it's getting awfully painful just being me, and living like this. I know and hope it'll be better soon, but right now things look awfully grim and I don't know what to do about any of yhis. I don't know what I'm expecting from posting this, I'm just hoping maybe writing it out could help somehow.","I don't know how to deal with this anymore.Since I could remember I've always been off emotionally, I've tried therapy, and medications it never helped.

1394,How do you pull yourself together when you're not motivated?,"Hello. I (23F) have tried to make a post to explain what's going on with me, but I just end up crying, and everything I write is incoherent, so. Sorry if there's not enough context?

I'm having a really difficult time right now. I can't really focus on work, and I don't get in as many hours as I should. I feel like I am letting people down. 

Existing is exhausting, and all I can do is waste time on my phone, because if I'm on my phone I don't have to think and time passes more quickly. 
I'm tired of spending hours on my phone instead of doing functional-people things, I'm just putting everything off and setting myself up for failure. But doing anything productive feels too daunting, and I don't know how to start? 

I want to develop healthy habits - spend less time on my phone, maybe go outside more often, go on walks, stick to my work schedule, find hobbies. Simple things that I know would improve my mental health.
But even though I want those things, I feel like I'm not motivated enough to make a change. It's always easier to stay in my comfort zone, to distract myself. My brain says I need to change, but I feel like I don't want it bad enough to actually try. 

I can't keep living like this, though. 

I've tried looking for advice online, but everything I see involves:
- Therapy, which I don't have money for. 
- Reaching out, but I have very few people I'm close with, and I don't feel comfortable talking about my mental health to any of them. 
- Self-help books and stuff, which just...does not work on me.
- Hobbies, but I don't really have any of those anymore? I've been depressed for so long, I've lost interest in the ones I used to have as a kid, and never developed new ones. 

So I guess I'm wondering/hoping you all might have some advice on how to get a bit better, something that doesn't involve the things I just mentioned ? 

I don't know. I wish wanting to get better was enough to spur me into action. Sorry if what I'm asking for doesn't exist, or if I wasn't very clear.

I don't work out anymore, have been skipping meals and either sleep too much or too little. I'm paying less attention to myself and my responsibilities and I'm worried this is gonna ruin my life sometime soon. 

What should I do?","Didn't go out of bed in the whole weekendI've been feeling like a piece of trash lately. I'm not doing anything for myself.

61,Cutting,"Hello,

Yesterday I cut myself, on my arm. I'm wondering how it will heal?

I feel terrible about it, and really don't want anyone to see my arm. But I can't hide it forever, and my girlfriend will see it eventually. I can hide it from other people, but not her. I just wanted to escape my thoughts but they have only turned worse as a result of what I did. Usually I'll just hit my knuckles into walls, until I physically can't do it anymore. But that heals faster, from what I've heard this can take a while.

1894,Advice?,"Hi, 

In advance! I’m not the best out there on explaining my feelings since that’s very far away from my culture, but I’ll try because I don’t know what else to do. 

I’m 26 and not too long ago I changed my career path to something which I’ve always wanted to do. Prior to this, which was about a year and a half ago I felt as though I’ve been in an emotional hole I couldn’t get out of. My new job distracted me for a long while, I was even being complimented on how I suddenly seemed like “myself” again up until about 6 months ago, when I just fell back in to my own bullshit of complete and utter numbness.

The issue is, that normally lasts a few weeks for me but it’s been 6 months (or longer) now and I can’t seem to shake it. I don’t want to speak to anybody, I love my family and friends but I can’t seem to…make the effort I guess? This resulted in me losing important connections and even severing them because I can’t for the life of me understand what the point of them is when I can’t be a good person to them. Then I have the audacity to feel loneliness and feel even more sorry for myself 😂 When I do talk to the people I have left I can’t focus on the conversation and I just drift off in to absolutely nothing, so it never lasts long. 

My question is to those who have managed to get through this without medication (I can’t have medication due to the nature of my job) How did you manage to do it? Am I missing something? I will do everything I possibly can to help myself but I’ve tried so much. I got back in the gym, I’m eating well, I’ve meditated, I’ve gone for walks, I’ve listened to music to self medicate, I’ve slept decent amounts. I can’t seem to enjoy doing anything anymore and my passion for life has been put out like someone suddenly pissed on a bonfire. I feel like I get closer and closer to giving up everyday and I’m just too close to it this time to the point I’m starting to scare myself every now and again with the thoughts that come in to my mind. 

Any suggestions would help so much.","Advice?Hi,

1609,Starting a new job with depression,"I’m seeking some advice. I recently started a new job. 

I’m suffering severe depression at the moment which has worsened after a breakup (bit of background, I’ve suffered from depression on and off for the last 10+ years). Unmediated right now - thinking of going back back but afraid of going back to my old cycles. I’ve been in some very dark places recently and have regular ideation. I’m okay right now - I’m lucid and not distressed or apathetic to the point of wanting to end things.

As mentioned, I recently started a new job. A promotion in my current company. My HR team is aware of my history and medical record. But I’m finding it hard at the moment to settle into my new role. I’m swinging between showing enthusiasm and working to prove myself to complete apathy and disinterest in any kind of future it might bring me. It’s making things really hard for me. It’s like a part of me doesn’t care at all, even though the doors are opening for me to do the things I’ve wanted to do for such a long time. I can’t seem to find any kind of joy. I feel grateful to my new boss for the opportunity and I know I’m just onboarding so it’s still early but there’s a part of me that doesn’t care if I crash and burn. It’s like I’m waiting for it. I want to keep fighting and find myself again but I don’t know how.

What do I do? I mean, I know how to bring up my insurance and payment methods in a professional manner but that’s all I know I can do. Do I bring up my problems before the appointment so that she can be prepared, or do I wait? What’s the formality usually like for these things? And besides all this just to get the ball rolling, is there anything else I need to do that isn’t obvious? I just want to get better so my family isn’t so worried about me but I sincerely don’t know.

1713,I need help,"I'm going to open up and be honest just because I'm at a breaking point. This is a breakup story that has been like non before. 

I (M27) was dating a beautiful girl (F24) on and off for three years. We met in college where we dated for a year before we separated the first time. In that first year she had to have surgery to remove a bone spur on her foot and put on some weight. Personally that doesn't bother me. I've never cared for my ladies weight, I'm more into the personality, but it mattered to her as I saw her put herself in a bout of depression, harsh judgements to herself, and ultimately was just very unhappy all the time. I did all I could, telling her not to worry about it, cooking healthier meals, telling her she's just not as active. And eventually after 6 months of recovery we started to go back to the gym but she was never the same so. And after having to remind her everyday, every conversation that everything would be ok to no aval, I broke up with her. (I regret this decision). I made this decision because I too, to some degree am self conscious and at the time I took it as a response to me. I thought she was unhappy with me.

We ended up trying again a short 4 months later but it too was short lived. Same result, every conversation we'd have, she'd talk about her weight, and I could see in her face how unhappy she was. This was also a bad time in her family as her mother just got breast cancer. So she went back home. On the way home (AL -&gt; KY) her car broke down and without hesitation I drove the 4 hours to meet up with her to fix her car and drove back because I still loved her. During this time covid began and any shot of seeing her was gone. I just started a 6 month coding boot camp where my days we're pretty much planned from 8am-8pm Monday - Saturday. We had talked about how I could be a developer, working from anywhere and I could be with her and she was a marine biologist, so her work was dependant on location so I was okay with going wherever she needed to be. (While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives).

After I graduated bootcamp I moved to Washington State, to gain some world experience and she did the same thing, but interning in the Caribbean as a marine biology instructor. I started at this time having extremely unhealthy night terrors. I was still madly in love with her, I had a ring in mind from our first relationship and one night was exceedingly bad. The next morning I told myself that I would reach out to her, tell her the truth of what I was feeling. So I did. I told her about how much I missed her, my night terrors, why we separated and my insecurities about how she was feeling at the time. And I told her that I still loved her and either needed her in my life or I had to completely cut her out because my mental health was really bad. These night terrors are demons like no other. I hop no one has to be afraid to sleep because they may experience watching and hearing their ex get railed by guy after guy. It truly is a haunting experience.

After I reached out she told me she had missed me, and felt the same. We talked about what thing's would be different and how we would be able to go on from there. She had 2 months left in her internship before she came back to the states. During this time we talked about the future, where she wanted to work, when we could see each other again, things we could do etc etc... The reason it was difficult is because I landed a job as a software developer in idaho that only pays 52/yr. So plane tickets from Kentucky aren't the cheapest. I also got us a hotel room and tickets to see one of our favorite bands tame impala. Well. When the day finally came where she returned to the states something happened. She did a complete 180 and told me she no longer wanted a relationship and wanted to be independent to travel the world and teach Marine biology. I was always supportive of this idea but the way she described it to me seemed that instead of a partner, I was more of an obstacle. And she eventually ended the relationship.

I was hurt, really really bad. I was sad, and angry, I felt like I was used and treated like what we had was nothing. And everything we talked about leading up to her return was all a joke. But now I'm left with nothing but night terrors. Every night I go to sleep, after drinking and smoking a large amount to try and numb my senses before I doze off. And last night was the first night the night terrors returned. I could hear vividly my ex getting railed by some imaginary ghost figure of my dreams. My heart bleeds and I'm at a point mentally where I can feel myself slowly changing as a result of seeing these terrors over and over again. 

I don't know what to do. I can't make it stop. I have 1 friend that I've told and I can't tell my family. I wish all of this came out differently. I wish I was a stronger man and was able to stick it out with her during that time. I wish I could've married this girl of my dreams and built a life together. But now I'm left with the fact that she is going to be seeing someone else and I'm here in idaho, having night terrors, about the one that got away.","I need helpI'm going to open up and be honest just because I'm at a breaking point.

I (M27) was dating a beautiful girl (F24) on and off for three years. We met in college where we dated for a year before we separated the first time. In that first year she had to have surgery to remove a bone spur on her foot and put on some weight. Personally that doesn't bother me. I've never cared for my ladies weight, I'm more into the personality, but it mattered to her as I saw her put herself in a bout of depression, harsh judgements to herself, and ultimately was just very unhappy all the time. I did all I could, telling her not to worry about it, cooking healthier meals, telling her she's just not as active. And eventually after 6 months of recovery we started to go back to the gym but she was never the same so. And after having to remind her everyday, every conversation that everything would be ok to no aval, I broke up with her. (I regret this decision). I made this decision because I too, to some degree am self conscious and at the time I took it as a response to me. I thought she was unhappy with me.

We ended up trying again a short 4 months later but it too was short lived. Same result, every conversation we'd have, she'd talk about her weight, and I could see in her face how unhappy she was. This was also a bad time in her family as her mother just got breast cancer. So she went back home. On the way home (AL -&gt; KY) her car broke down and without hesitation I drove the 4 hours to meet up with her to fix her car and drove back because I still loved her. During this time covid began and any shot of seeing her was gone. I just started a 6 month coding boot camp where my days we're pretty much planned from 8am-8pm Monday - Saturday. We had talked about how I could be a developer, working from anywhere and I could be with her and she was a marine biologist, so her work was dependant on location so I was okay with going wherever she needed to be. (While in the bootcamp, we rarely talked, living our separate lives).

After I graduated bootcamp I moved to Washington State, to gain some world experience and she did the same thing, but interning in the Caribbean as a marine biology instructor. I started at this time having extremely unhealthy night terrors. I was still madly in love with her, I had a ring in mind from our first relationship and one night was exceedingly bad. The next morning I told myself that I would reach out to her, tell her the truth of what I was feeling. So I did. I told her about how much I missed her, my night terrors, why we separated and my insecurities about how she was feeling at the time. And I told her that I still loved her and either needed her in my life or I had to completely cut her out because my mental health was really bad. These night terrors are demons like no other. I hop no one has to be afraid to sleep because they may experience watching and hearing their ex get railed by guy after guy. It truly is a haunting experience.

After I reached out she told me she had missed me, and felt the same. We talked about what thing's would be different and how we would be able to go on from there. She had 2 months left in her internship before she came back to the states. During this time we talked about the future, where she wanted to work, when we could see each other again, things we could do etc etc... The reason it was difficult is because I landed a job as a software developer in idaho that only pays 52/yr. So plane tickets from Kentucky aren't the cheapest. I also got us a hotel room and tickets to see one of our favorite bands tame impala. Well. When the day finally came where she returned to the states something happened. She did a complete 180 and told me she no longer wanted a relationship and wanted to be independent to travel the world and teach Marine biology. I was always supportive of this idea but the way she described it to me seemed that instead of a partner, I was more of an obstacle. And she eventually ended the relationship.

I was hurt, really really bad. I was sad, and angry, I felt like I was used and treated like what we had was nothing. And everything we talked about leading up to her return was all a joke. But now I'm left with nothing but night terrors. Every night I go to sleep, after drinking and smoking a large amount to try and numb my senses before I doze off. And last night was the first night the night terrors returned. I could hear vividly my ex getting railed by some imaginary ghost figure of my dreams. My heart bleeds and I'm at a point mentally where I can feel myself slowly changing as a result of seeing these terrors over and over again. 

I don't know what to do. I can't make it stop. I have 1 friend that I've told and I can't tell my family. I wish all of this came out differently. I wish I was a stronger man and was able to stick it out with her during that time. I wish I could've married this girl of my dreams and built a life together. But now I'm left with the fact that she is going to be seeing someone else and I'm here in idaho, having night terrors, about the one that got away.",poi king help honest tor non story dating year girl time year college weigh year surgery weight son personal car lad time judge red weigh son depression weight press mate personality men ion personal meal alt health king cooking sam art back event month recovery star gym conversation day mind ion decision regret ion decision self_conscious time response ion end month live sam conversation weigh face weight talk ion time cancer mother family breast_cancer back home back car home meet love ion time art cam plan month day days star end kay king dan cat talk work location developer ion cam talk live living sam state car experience tor cam instructor world biology alt art health night_terrors time healthy night terror star ship night mind love relationship ion morning feeling fee feel truth night_terrors time night feeling terror fee feel tie alt health my_life mental_health life cut mental love men night_terrors night terror experience sleep watch experience sam rent talk state back left ship cam month time talk work future job reason war pay land son soft developer cheap plan plane ban hotel band room well state cam day return tea travel longer ship end world independent biology relationship ion tea support art partner bed ship end event relationship ion nothing angry eat treat joke lead talk return nothing left night_terrors night terror sleep smoking ink king drinking night drink night_terrors night terror return dream ghost my_ex host art heart poi mentally terror fee mental feel men end friend family my_family wish cam rent wish time man dream wish life girl left night_terrors night terror,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'yes']]"

113,Losing all hope,"I've always struggled with depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and body image issues. I've not had an easy go but always tried hard to better myself and get well. I got sober 1.5 years ago, am in therapy, regularly practice yoga and meditation, take antidepressants, get plenty of sleep, eat well, the whole fucking thing. I have a wonderful supportive husband whom I love, and with whom I had looked forward to building a life and having a family. 

And yet my depression still remains. In the last year, I have studied philosophy and spirituality and religion and cosmology and neuroscience and evolution and the more I learn the more I am convinced: there is no benevolent god, the universe is random and absurd, and life is essentially meaningless. There may have been a creator entity, but its far removed from humanity. I recently watched True Detective and the main character says, *""I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, this accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody.""* I agree with this statement entirely and had never heard anyone say it so succinctly. 

I have felt an urge to try and find some meaning in the world and in my life, that maybe I could climb out of the hole of depression someday, in many ways because of my husband. Until now. My husband is leaving me. He just started his dream job a few months ago, and he's suddenly decided he wants that more than me. That he wants to throw his whole life into work, and doesn't want to be married, or have a family, anymore. (Note: He is not leaving because I am depressed - he is leaving because he doesn't think he can be a good husband for me while he does this job, and this job is more important to him than I am.)

This pain...its just not bearable. It cuts to the heart in a way that is not describable. I fall to my knees sobbing and begging the universe to give me a sign, ANY sign, that I should keep going, that there is something worth living for, that there is some meaning in this, that the pain will be worth it in the end. But there is no sign coming. 

And I look at the world and the enormity of suffering in other places, where children are slaughtered in wars, where women are beaten and raped, where people shoot up schools and kill kindergartners...I look at the people who COULD NOT get sober, at the people who COULD NOT get well, or the people who never had a chance to, because their life was randomly taken from them in a car crash or from cancer or some other bullshit reason. 

And then I think about the evolution of humankind. I think of all of the millions of creatures that evolved from reptiles to mammals to apes to hominids. At what point did homo sapiens become conscious beings? At one point did we discover sense of ""self""? At what point did ""meaning"" begin to matter to us?  For all of the many millions of beings that lived before that moment - they had no meaning or purpose. And they represent the VAST majority of the history of animals, of life. And that life? Only represents a tiny fraction of the history of this universe. 

**There. Is. No. Meaning.** There is no way to reconcile how some people have the chances and opportunities to grow and to get stronger, while others do not. There is no way to reconcile the fact that our suffering is a blip in comparison to the enormity of the universe and spacetime.","Losing all hopeI've always struggled with depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and body image issues.

749,Depressed Partner (quarantine),"Hi!

F(29) M(29)

My partner of 2 years asked me for space on Thursday after his therapist appointment.He said he didn't want to make any rushed decision (breakup) until he had a more clear view of things.We had just moved in together in January and now he isn't sure if he was ready. He has been struggling with being stuck at home, no sports on tv, and me nagging him to get out of the house with me for walks or just even eating in our patio. I had no background or knew how to deal with depression so I cried and made him feel responsible for what he was feeling. He said he was confused and didn't know if the quarantine or our relationship where the real cause of his depression. I left but didn't even hug him. I made some research and felt so gulty of not being compassionate to him and went back on Friday to beg him to trust me. He said he still needed time but that everything I had said helped him. I stayed away but reading everything I could, joined TalkSpace (which has helped me a lot) and felt very connected with people going through the same thing. I slowly realized his illness made him so unworthy of love that he felt that me being out of his life would help him. I kept on sending text of encourganmet once a day and have food, essentials deliveries to the house (the quarantine does not help). Today I came over in the morning and let our dog out and fed her. He was still in bed, I came in the room hugged him and reassured I would always be here. He had a drained/sad look on his face but hugged me back. I said I LOVE YOU and he could bearly get the words out. I then left..... I just need some help knowing things will pass. Ive done evrything I can and all left its to wait. Its just seems impossible when all I really want to do is hug him every morning.","Depressed Partner (quarantine)Hi!

1899,"Slipping back into a depressive episode, but this time the stress in not very manageable","Basically, to sum it up:

&gt;moved from overseas back to the states. Month or so later move to CA with family member, because they said I could have a really good opportunity. Their job fell through, we move back to home state. Ended up moving Moved to a new place with a family member in a different city months later. Covid starts. No job. Family member says I have a few years with them and it’s okay. Fast forward to this year - they get into a relationship and now want to move in with them / kick me out. 

I have no car because their extra car went to my other family member (who already had two cars) for I don’t know why. They told me I could share their car it’s no problem, assuming in a year or so I’d be good enough to move out. 

But now I have 6 months, little work, no car, and I have to be ready to go somewhere. I’ve done about 20 or 25 applications and only three got back to me saying no. I feel like the whole reason I was able to stay with my family member was out of obligation and they were lonely. Now since they aren’t lonely, it’s now my fault for not working during Covid and being “ambition-less” - despite pouring time into now what’s a contracted job of audio engineering (audio is my passion). 

So now I have less than a year and at the moment months before I’m homeless. I’m not on my meds anymore, I was on viibryd for a while. Now I’m starting to feel like there is an easy way out of this.  I feel like my situation isn’t my fault, but to my family member they think I deserve this. 

One thing that annoys me is that we would make a deal in which I can do x and y for my family member and I would get paid weekly for it during Covid . But that always ended up falling through because they quit.  Also the fact that the premise of their thoughts was that they are lonely , won’t find anyone, so no rush. But now they found someone to settle with, and suddenly im put into this situation. 

There is a lot more, but it’s risky to say because of my family members social status.","Slipping back into a depressive episode, but this time the stress in not very manageableBasically, to sum it up:

I feel more depressed now than ever before in my life.","I've posted about my current situation in other subreddits asking for advice, people don't believe me. I don't know what to do. My posts get removed, I do not know why.

Here is my situation, I posted about this on tifu and other subreddits.

Throwaway account. This did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up that's been building up steam for months now. Please Reddit I need your help, and advice. Please!

I've been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when you've been married for this long, lot's of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that other's sometimes just can't comprehend. At times I feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here Tallahassee, in bum fuck Florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? Sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, I hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where I'm coming from. Working as an insurance broker living paycheck to paycheck wasn't my dream job, yet its the one I have to make due with, but I guess all this shit really started just after my 4th son was born, at home my relationship with my wife begun souring. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboro's, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. She began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again I would go to her, try to get it on like I had done before, and I just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when I was looking to get it on with her. But this pattern, this taboo purgatory I now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. Not only did I now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where I couldn't even relax in peace like I used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure I found being with her. I had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything I had to our family, and now this is the thanks I got. She would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like I hadn't, when she knew damn well I was exhausted after work at night times. So I decided from then on I had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances I now faced.

Inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release I well deserved; after work I began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, I instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where I was, that I was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldn't even look into anyways. At those clubs I had the time of my life. It became like an addiction to me. For weeks upon weeks I'd go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, I didn't just savior my time there I indulged in it, there I'd hook up with women looking for more than just fun. For some reason during this time I was able to hook up with a few local black chicks that'd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did I ever think I as a blond ass kid from Pensacola would I be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, we'd hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot we'd drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time I'd never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time I just didn't care. During this time I met this hot black chick with an afro, we'll call her ""Mandy"", and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. We grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon I grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. I even took several ""business trips"" to her place during this time. Every time I went it was well worth it. At first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. Finally for once in my life I thought I had found the perfect work life, sex balance. I'd wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on. And finally with Mandy in the mix, I had someone to actually connect to when I wanted. Unlike my wife she was in her early 20s, my wife late 40s, I've seen garbage fires that look better than her. Mandy always gave excellent blowjobs, its like she had lips of an angel, unlike my wife who never gave me oral. But that's when everything went to shit. Mandy came to me two weeks ago, and stated she's pregnant. She took a test, and showed me the results. I don't know what to do, I can't let my wife, or kids find out. Mandy is threatening to tell my wife, about her, and the baby. She has been calling he angrily about this, she blames me for her pregnancy, but she wants to keep that baby. She tells me she doesn't want to be ""just the other woman."" She doesn't want to be ""a dirty little secret."" I don't know what to do. I got so angry at that fucking bitch, we got into a heated argument. I haven't been going to work for the past few days now, I've been making sure Mandy doesn't come to my house, if she does, I'm thinking of calling the cops on that thug. I can't let my wife, or my kids know the truth. I need your help, please, what should I do? I need help, and advice. I want to save the marriage, I can't let my kids go through a divorce, my wife still does not know anything. I hate this whole fucking situation. I hate my life, why the hell would this happen to me?? How can I convince Mandy not to tell my wife? I don't know what to do, should I get a restraining order on her? Please help me anyone, I don't know who to go to for help.

TL:DR had several affairs with women I met at nightclubs, hit it off really well with one, now she's pregnant, and wants to tell my wife!

Please help me, I don't want to live anymore, I'm thinking of running off, maybe buying a shotgun. Where can I turn to? Help please anyone. My life is worthless.

239,SO says it's depression linked. How to stop being too much?,"Hello (Lengthy post, so I'm sorry in advance if I waste your time),

I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesn't affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because other's have it worse (and most likely would be a waste on me anyway).

When I'm a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleagues/team mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as:

If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill / lounge around and still keep the job that's equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior.

My managers and colleagues say I'm too much and ""old""-friends have ended friendships due to me being ""too nice"".

At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe I'll ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that aren't enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse.

I have been told all my life I am too much, or just ""too"" something, but it's more of an insult now, even if it is said with positive intention. I just want to be ""enough"". Nothing more, nothing less.

This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didn't focus on helping others so much, but I didn't even realise I was focusing. She tells me I'm ""too nice"" about once a month.

After talking to my current SO, she says it is depression.

Thank you for your time, and sorry for wasting time if you read this and don't know how to help,

849,"To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways.","My mom just got high blood pressure today. And it's my fucking fault.

Since I don't live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy.

Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her life's mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said ""I'm fine."" Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just can't bring myself to tell you. I'm sorry.

Within the several days, my mom *really* tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didn't let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldn't swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like they're lying, that it's their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and *so much time.* 

I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger I'd hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband. We don't get along, and they always gang up on me, saying how my best friend did this better than me, I was always so bad at this or that, or how I was so fake and I always lied to them. They say other things too.

My mom started this nightly ritual for me, and it really helps. She'd take Vaseline, which would help heal wounds, and she'd spread it all over my arm where I'd hurt myself. Then after that she takes this long see-through sash, and she'd tie and secure it on my arm so I don't pick at my wounds and scabs at night, because I do that a lot just so I could feel the pain. But every time in the morning and afternoon, I'd always reopen and add more cuts and pinches onto my arms. This really stresses out my mom because I never stop, even if she really begs me to. I just get mad at her and say that it helps me.

Today, I had gotten into a pretty bad argument with my sister and brother-in-law. The previous night, I snuck my iPad into my room (no electronics in my room), and I stayed up till 4 am playing and talking with friends, who were pulling an all-nighter. It was fun, until my brother in law read my messages without me know and he found out. He got really pissed, and they enforced my already strict parental controls on my iPad, and now I can only strictly use it for a few hours at a time. They also deleted a few of my apps they didn't like me using because they didn't use it and found it a waste of time (the apps were things like TikTok and some games). While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it. I got really stressed, and I couldn't vent because I could only text on my iPad and computer (which was in the living room, and I didn't want to see their faces). So I resorted to using the back of a scissor blade, and ran it back and forth on my arm with all the scabs, and I scraped off the scabs + 2-3 layers of skin. It wasn't bleeding much, so I just cleaned it and let it dry. 

Then when my mom called me to go on a family walk, I flat out refused, and I started yelling at her for never understanding me, and how fucked up I always felt, and how tired I was (I had cried a few times earlier) and I just wanted to never see their faces for the rest of the day. Then my mom saw my arm, and she just left the room. Then around 2-3 minutes later, I hear my sister freaking out about my mom having a bloody nose. A few moments later, my mom started spitting out blood, and that's when we decided to bring her to the ER.

On the return trip from the ER, my sister just glares at me and says how the blood was triggered due to stress, and how we were lucky it was only some blood, since she could've gotten a stroke. My mom starts trying to explain to me that it wasn't my fault, but she just starts tearing up in the middle of it. Of course, that's the last thing me and my sister want, so we just shut up and try to comfort her before something else happens.

Then at home, after I had taken a shower and was trying not to cry as I explained the whole situation to my best friends, my mom just comes out of the room with Vaseline and sash in hand. She starts binding my arm, even though I was the one who caused her to be so sick, and she acted like nothing happened and tried to comfort me as I started shaking.

I feel so bad. I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm just wondering if my mom really needs a child like me. Maybe she's better off with my older sister and her perfect husband and perfect child. I stand out in the picture anyways.","To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways.My mom just got high blood pressure today. And it's my fucking fault.

Since I don't live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy.

Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her life's mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said ""I'm fine."" Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just can't bring myself to tell you. I'm sorry.

Within the several days, my mom *really* tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didn't let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldn't swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like they're lying, that it's their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and *so much time.* 

I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger I'd hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband. We don't get along, and they always gang up on me, saying how my best friend did this better than me, I was always so bad at this or that, or how I was so fake and I always lied to them.

I feel a little inferior to him and constantly downplay myself without knowing how to stop. Both events struck me profoundly and I'm confused as to what to do.

But I am so tired.

To make a long story short, I was emotionally, physically, verbally, and sexually abused for the first eleven years of my life, and now I am adopted by my godparents, who I highly respect as my mother and father.Anyways, like I said, I'm a private person. This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others- I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude.  So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But it's been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse.

But I take it, and I bounce back.Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think it's weird of me. Because I always get back on my feet without them knowing I fell. But I am so tired of getting back up. Of forgiving everyone that has hurt me over and over. Of taking all of those offensive comments silently. Of fulfilling the expectations of those around me when I already expect perfection out of myself.

1677,Suicidal Thoughts,"I think about killing myself every week. Every time I do, I feel like I’m inching more and more toward the day I’d actually do it, like I’m on a train speeding toward a cliff and there’s nothing I can do to stop it. I compose the letters I’d leave behind bit by bit in my head.

‘ … Brother, you’re the first-born son our parents should’ve had, and you’ll do a much better job at it than I have. I love you and I’m truly sorry for everything. … Sister, I love you too and I’m sorry for everything. … Dad, I know you only wanted to do good. I know you wanted the best for us. I know you tried. I’m sorry I couldn’t be the son you wanted to have. And I’m sorry for destroying your marriage. Pray for me. … ‘

As to my mother, I couldn’t even begin to think of the words I’d leave behind for her. She deserves more. She deserves more than she ever had.

I know I shouldn’t be feeling this way and thinking like this but I’m a burden, a bug in the matrix and they will all be better off without me. I came to a happy family and I ruined everything.

I feel irrevocably, irreconcilably lost. I don’t fit anywhere, I don’t belong with anyone and wherever I take refuge I’m eventually discovered to be the anomaly I am.

My brain bullies me, my dad lost hope on me and I feel like an injured kid that has fallen into a well and is crying for help.

I’m aware I’m looking for sympathy here and that makes my squirm into myself and want to disappear. Any torch of hope is much appreciated.

499,How do I become a person?,"Ok That might be a weird question but I needed to ask. 

I’ve had depression all my life. During early childhood, teenage years, and now as an adult. 

Happiness is exhausting. Nothing is relaxing. Everything is just boring. I’m either angry or I’m numb. I don’t even take showers to feel clean anymore. I just take them so I can waste time and feel like I can go to bed sooner.

Here’s my problem. I don’t remember if I developed a personality before my depression took over. I don’t know if I was a real person as a child, or if I was just a puppet or something. 

I feel like I’m floating in life and I don’t know how to develop a personality. Does anyone have any ideas at all where I can start? Things that used to calm me down just make me angry and frustrated.

So I usually don’t do this and I’m not sure if anyone will respond but I just feel like I need to say something, for the last 2 years I have been at rock bottom, I don’t have anyone to reply on at the end of the day it’s just me. Everyone I talk to I just can’t connect with and I just feel like they don’t like me or care about me or anything I have to do with. I don’t do anything to make people hate me I just put it in my head and it begins to spread into the relationship with people. My co workers who say they are my friends say they care about me but when they see that I’m in a depressed mood they don’t do anything. I just feel like they are only in my life because of work. I have been thinking in my head every day that the world would be a better place if I weren’t in it people would just be happier to not have to deal with me. I even go to the point where I will make up reasons or find reasons to prove my point, even if I’m taking to a wrong way. I do this in every situation and just keep telling myself people don’t care about me and ride the proof to make it true. It makes me feel like The world would be better off with out me.","Need help

419,Ghosted by Son and His Mom,"I've been dealing really well with depression for awhile. Mostly just some hard spikes up in depression where it's a few hours of intense depression and anxiety. But this has got me in the numb, why bother zone, which I feel is the most dangerous because it can last for so long.

My son (late teens) and I had a pretty good relationship as far as I could tell, and for being half a country apart. We chatted online almost every day, and sometimes game online. It's his preferred way of communicating. We had a great time together this summer.

He stopped responding about 3 weeks ago. I texted him and he politely said the equivalent of, ""I need some space for about a week, just working something out."" I respect that and I let him know that.

I asked his mom if it was something I should worry about or if there's anything I can do to help. She responded that it's teenager stuff and he's not in danger. (Son lives with depression and anxiety too.)

So I give space.

2 weeks go by. I message him just to check in and let him know I love him. Nothing. Then a message about his upcoming psychologist appointment. I say that it's scary to me that he needs to see a psychologist, but I don't know anything about what's going on. No response.

I e-mail his mom, we mostly talk Christmas gifts but no answers about how our son is doing.

It's been over 3 weeks now. I e-mailed his mom again a couple days ago. No response. I'm worried for him. She has left me uninformed about very important things about our son before.

This is extremely unusual for him, especially for this time of year. We're usually chatting about Christmas stuff. I feel like throwing up. I'm very worried for him.

Maybe he is ok. Maybe this is just what happens. I understood the day could come when he goes off on his own and I'm an occasional thought and memory. That's what I could get for living so far away since he was a toddler.   
(Whole other story why that happened that I'm not going to get into.)

I'm not ready for it to be today. Especially knowing that something was wrong enough for him to go see a psychologist.

I don't know what to do or think about this. Any advice? I'm very much in the 'don't want to wake up tomorrow' space, but also want to be here in case he needs me.","Ghosted by Son and His MomI've been dealing really well with depression for awhile.

918,I want to be happy again.,"  

Goal: Currently I am all timer sad and want to be happy. 

I am neither a good person nor a bad person. I am somewhere in the middle or maybe totally out of circle. I don't know. 

I feel like I am living three lives. One which I show to my Family, one to friends and ex-colleagues. I am jobless. And one my true self which I show to myself only. Of course any differences in personality from my true self I manage by pretending someone else in my other two lives. But as soon as I enter my room and after carefully slowly locking my door I throw away the mask I was wearing and then I can clearly see the differences in my voice, thoughts, body language and goals, if any. My body feels so relieved. Then I start getting back in my true zone where I forget the tasks and goals I had planned in my mind. And I start feeding myself the worthless shit on Internet. At that time, I am only looking for that temporary dopamine hits because nothing simpler was giving me any joy. I started losing myself in weed. I sometimes was stealing weed from my friends or roommates. After smoking for at least 3 years, a small joint was not that powerful anymore to bring down the curtains covering my real life problems. So, I jumped to eating. Now again, simpler food was not any joy. Junk is pretty much gonna hit the D-spot. Small meals mean less dopamine. Give me more and more. Don't worry, I'll puke the previous and eat again until I am so wasted by the effort of eating - throwing - eating- throwing and of course the taste of food. There are consequences too. Bloating, Gas, Always upset. But nothing can stop me from doing it again and again atleast from last 2 years nothing has stopped me. Then in search for more dopamine I look for porn. Again, simple means no joy. Fell into Hetero-BBC - Trans - Sissy. Now I don't imagine me having sex with girl instead I am that girl and big funk is fucking me. I started dreaming about dicks. Bought a vibrating dildo. But deep inside I still have that longing for intimate relationships with girl. I never had any. 

I am king of overthinking. I think of every consequence of my actions. Like where I keep dishes in kitchen. Opening and closing door. Even when I am walking down the road. Striking a lighter to light my joint. everything small you can imagine. This makes me mad and too conscious. I keep thinking of my childhood scenes where I lived with my parents and always wondering how time has passed. I was a kid back then and now I am an adult. I am so obsessed with age of people. How old is he or she? That actor? That sports person? and then I compare what I was doing when I was 16, 18, 23 etc. I am 26 right now.   
 I don't check my actions usually but when I check them, they are bad. I am using same pair of clothes for months. Using same toothbrush for years. I have rarely gave any gifts to any one. I am not so close with my parents. I am single child. I lived in rented place for 11 years before leaving for another city for college. My parents finally have their own house now. We live with parents in India till death.   
 I used to steal erasers, scales etc. from school. Even from my parents too. I have been caught sometimes. I now realized that maybe I was less satisfied with myself. I always felt less because all my relatives and friends had there own houses and car. My parents had one two-wheeler and my parents used to fight with each other which used to make me very sad. When I used to watch other parents living happily, I used to think why I don't have that, why my parents are always fighting? This less feeling I still have with me. I still feel less.   
 I am lazy for sure. Now I am sitting idle from last 1 year. No job, no friends, no personal connection with any human being. I never tell my secrets to anyone. Living in a rented room. Financially fucked, Relationships fucked.   
 I feel like a failure. I failed to become a good son, friend, brother, grandson or colleague.   
 I have become more secretive from last 2 years. I eat secretly, want to live secretly (deleting my pictures from social media).   
 I sometimes think If my parents die then I would have no one to answer and then I can live this miserable life for long. I don't think about my future at all. I have not reached the suicide point yet but I think this is how you reach there eventually. I can't imagine myself having a simple life with family and kids and work. I get very anxious imagining that will I be able to do that for these many years. I blame myself for all this. I did not take action when it was needed.   


In the end, I just want to be happy. ","I want to be happy again.

How old is he or she? That actor? That sports person? and then I compare what I was doing when I was 16, 18, 23 etc. I am 26 right now.   
 I don't check my actions usually but when I check them, they are bad. I am using same pair of clothes for months. Using same toothbrush for years. I have rarely gave any gifts to any one. I am not so close with my parents. I am single child. I lived in rented place for 11 years before leaving for another city for college. My parents finally have their own house now. We live with parents in India till death.   
 I used to steal erasers, scales etc. from school. Even from my parents too. I have been caught sometimes. I now realized that maybe I was less satisfied with myself. I always felt less because all my relatives and friends had there own houses and car. My parents had one two-wheeler and my parents used to fight with each other which used to make me very sad. When I used to watch other parents living happily, I used to think why I don't have that, why my parents are always fighting? This less feeling I still have with me. I still feel less.   
 I am lazy for sure. Now I am sitting idle from last 1 year. No job, no friends, no personal connection with any human being. I never tell my secrets to anyone. Living in a rented room. Financially fucked, Relationships fucked.   
 I feel like a failure. I failed to become a good son, friend, brother, grandson or colleague.   
 I have become more secretive from last 2 years. I eat secretly, want to live secretly (deleting my pictures from social media).   
 I sometimes think If my parents die then I would have no one to answer and then I can live this miserable life for long. I don't think about my future at all. I have not reached the suicide point yet but I think this is how you reach there eventually. I can't imagine myself having a simple life with family and kids and work. I get very anxious imagining that will I be able to do that for these many years. I blame myself for all this. I did not take action when it was needed.   


In the end, I just want to be happy. ",time rent son middle fee feel live living league end colleague friend show family my_family job show end ending son age live man difference personality personal throw car ice ref body clear wear king age voice my_room ask difference language room body fee feel my_body lie art back plan ask mind star art net fee star nothing tempo time king mine look art sing weed star tea end time friend roommate my_friend weed my_friends mate room power mall join smoking problem life king year real_life covering eat eating food pot meal mall mine throw eat taste eating waste food upset set nothing year mine search look tea fun sex king girl art dick dream star rating bra inside ship girl mate relationship ion ink king thinking think ink action ion think kitchen dish sing walk walking king join king light mall scene my_parents time ink king rent live child childhood thinking think back adult people age actor tor sports son right action check ion sam sing clothes month air sam sing rush year gif gift my_parents rent sing single child city year rent live college my_parents house rent death eat rent live tea school my_parents rent time car house end friend my_parents rent fight heel my_parents watch ink rent fight living think feeling fee feel fee feel lazy year idle job end friend son man human ion human_being personal rent living room ship financial relationship ion failure fee feel league end colleague friend son brother year media eat social_media live social my_parents time life ink rent live think ink future think event suicide poi ink think life work family year man action ion end,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'yes'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'yes'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'yes'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]"

2000,I've always been depressed but somethings different.,"Lately I've been having extreme difficulty leaving my room. Everytime I'm around anyone my heart starts racing and I feel like I'm having a panic attack. I also keep hearing people Whispering to me but I can't tell what they say and sometimes they manifest as full on people that I can see and carry on conversations with. Also I've been noticing that everything has a dark and sinister undertone. I hear people's conversations and things on TV and I can't help but think they relate to me and my living situation in a dark and sinister way somehow. And I've completely given up trying to talk to anyone about anything because no one can understand me. They say I talk too fast or say things that ""don't make sense"" or that they find ""incoherent"" and Lately i feel my life is just dragging on and on. Idk it just feels like I've become a ghost of myself and I'm being driven by something else. Like some baleful evil shadow from beyond time and space has grabbed onto my soul and slipped itself into my television consciousness and is now possessing me. Please help? Is it normal to feel this way?","I've always been depressed but somethings different.Lately I've been having extreme difficulty leaving my room.

1817,Scared to call crisis services,"I'm in the USA. I have no insurance and effectively no money (like, none; I have some family, but asking them is out of the question). I'm pretty sure something's pretty wrong, considering I've been crying and panicking and bludgeoning myself and thinking about suicide for years now, but I don't have any resources to go to an actual doctor.

Earlier tonight when I was more worked up I called the US national suicide prevention hotline. The guy I talked to gave me the number for mobile crisis services in my (rural) county. I explained my financial/insurance situation to him and he assured me that if I call them, a doctor with this service will come to my location and it's free, no charge…

…but even if it's true, what then?

I can't imagine they're going to actually do anything except take me to a hospital, stick me there for a few days, maybe they give me some medication… and then they release me and tell me to make a follow up appointment with a doctor somewhere I can't pay and probably can't physically get to (no car, rural area), and I get a bill for the hospital stay. Which I categorically will not be able to pay. If that's what would happen, I truly am better off dead.

TL;DR I want help but I strongly suspect that if I ask for any, I'm only going to get the opposite. Am I crazy or am I right?","Scared to call crisis servicesI'm in the USA.

1156,I think I messed up trying to make sure my kids had a different childhood than i did.,"Sorry for the rant and sorry for the grammar, I feel like I just hit a damn wall !

I have 3 kids I grew up in a toxic family mom and dad divorced, seen my dad get locked up a lot my mom never being around because she worked so much. 

I always wanted my kids to have a better life than me, you know the American dream mom and dad that stayed together. I didn’t want them becoming a statistic, I guess the toxic thing never went away. My husband and I have known each other since 1999, his dad died in March of 99 and my dad April of 98 we did a lot of stupid shit drugs and staying drunk and all kinds of dumb stuff. We broke up right after he turned 21 because he didn’t want me in his life, I caught him cheating. Well a drunken booty call in October I ended up pregnant, I was happy and we “ tried “ to work it out, he left me high and dry for most of my pregnancy and the first 2 years of our sons life. Toxic family told him I was sleeping with everything that had a penis so our son wasn’t his, his mom paid for a paternity test came back he is 99.9999999% the father ( duh I knew that). Stupid me went back again to him, we moved in together he lied to me every chance we are very toxic for each other. We got married in 2006 had a kid 2007, from 2007 till 2011-2012 something like that he cheated again and made me feel like it was my fault, he lied to me about everything! But he promised he’d be better and he was always sooo very sorry. Fast Forward a couple years his best friends dad died when I was going to leave him and take the kids, he begged me to stay I stayed. We hand another kid 2015 so I figured that was a sign telling me to stay things would get better. But all the things that could go wrong went wrong more lies, we lost our house our car and everything. He sucked at money he would spend spend spend stuff got cut off left and right got into them payday loan shit. Like I couldn’t trust a single word that came out of his mouth but i still stayed thinking it was what’s best for our kids. Fast forward to now 2021 we have 3 kids 1 son and 2 daughters. Our son graduated and works and pays his part of the insurance and the WiFi cause I said if we were getting the highest one he’d have to pay it. And he does he pays his part of insurance and the WiFi no questions asked. My husband is so hard on him every time he says he wants to get a new car or something he bitches cause he sleeps all day when he’s not at work unless he has something to do then he’ll get up and go do it. Our son is more responsible now than My husbands ever been in his 40 years of life. 

My son has anger issues and depression, yeah he got all that from me cause I’m super fucked up! My husband doesn’t think depression is real he says you just snap your self
Out of it. My son came to me yesterday soooo mad at his dad because his dad was bitching about anything and everything he wanted to do. Our son was super sick last week ( tested negative for covid) he was in bed all week. My husband has been using my car to go to work and the battery was bad so he was jumping it every morning with our sons car. Yesterday when our son went to work his car was making noises like the battery was messed up or he needs a new alternator ( he loves cars so he knows what the sounds mean lol)  I think my husband got defensive about it and was like well I didn’t do it ( my husband has totally messed up every single car we’ve owned and totaled my sons other car right before we moved and he doesn’t take any responsibility for any of it it’s always someone else’s fault or he says sorry and it’s never to be spoken of again that’s been our whole relationship) 

Anyway sorry my son came to me yesterday and was like why does dad make me feel like every time I wanna do something for myself I’m lazy or I’m not responsible enough. I told him I was sorry and I didn’t know but maybe it was because my son is more responsible than my husband has EVER been ! Then my son tells me and this isn’t the first time that he’s afraid to move out because he’s worried my husband will get us in another fucking money bind and he’s worried about his sisters. My heart doesn’t know what to feel I feel soooo bad that he feels he has to be responsible for his sisters cause he knows his dads gonna fuck something up. I’m trying to find a job but it’s always been the same all but one time when he was talking to another girl saying I was holding him back cleaning houses and I was a loser. After that time it’s always been well I make more money than you so you have to quit, like now we moved and I was supposed to get a job but I can’t he has my car to go to work. 

This is really all over the place and I am so sorry I just don’t know what to do my oldest is 18 and then I have a 13 yr old and a 5 year old. If me staying with his dad trying to have a “ real” family fucked him up what’s it going to do to my girls ? It’s not like I have anywhere to go anyway my family is so toxic my mom passively treats me like shit most of the time. I have no friends anymore my one cousin is so messed up right now with drinking and screwing her life up I can’t turn to her. My brothers been staying with my mom during the week and hotels on the weekends cause he’s fuxking up in life right now! My youngest sister the golden child looks down on me so I can’t go to her.  I don’t wanna mess my girls

800,I’m in desperate need of truthful comfort...,"I’ve recently turned 18-I have suffered domestic, emotional, mental and formerly physical abuse. As a result I have gotten depression and anxiety, both confirmed by a trained professional. I’ve reached out to my friends, to authorities, but they all treat me as if I need to be punished...I’m truly trying to reach out and the moment anyone’s nice to me I’m so scared to lose them
Now that I’ve gotten older some thoughts have come to hit me like a freight train

I know it sounds incredibly stupid but I’ve been researching articles about how far science is from being able to extend our lifespans...but honestly with so many people always either being unable to do much or just choose to punish me, I’m not sure how much longer I can last with this heavy thought of what comes after death

Medication doesn’t help, therapy doesn’t help, authorities told me to quote “Learn your place”...and before any of you say I haven’t found the right therapist, I’ve been to five different ones. Most of whom prescribed different medications

I suppose I dont blame authorities for shaming me and treating me like a slut....

Please...I want it to stop","I’m in desperate need of truthful comfort...I’ve recently turned 18-I have suffered domestic, emotional, mental and formerly physical abuse. As a result I have gotten depression and anxiety, both confirmed by a trained professional. I’ve reached out to my friends, to authorities, but they all treat me as if I need to be punished...I’m truly trying to reach out and the moment anyone’s nice to me I’m so scared to lose them

1115,To medicate or not..,"About 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with depression + anxiety: no biggie. It runs in the family, it's a biological depression as one side of the family doesn't produce enough serotonin, so nothing actually happened to me to set it off.
But it affected a lot of things that I wanted control over, I wasn't living my best life. 
I went on medication (Venlafaxin(effexor)), and it helped dramatically. Though I gained 15kgs in the 6 months.
So I came off. I've been good for 2 years, I got the weight back down, and I'm hovering between average and athletic.
But recent changes in my life have stirred the pot. 
Mirtazapine is a recommendation that *should* work differently and not cause the weight gain. 
I don't want to go on the meds again if I'm going to gain that weight back so fast. I don't want to be on meds my whole life like my family members.
But nor do I want to stay like I am currently.
So how do I decide? Flip a coin? 
My psychologist and psychiatrist haven't been able to help me make my mind up. 

Anybody been on mirtazapine? Does it cause weight gain and kill libido? Not that I have a libido at the moment anyway, thanks life 👍","To medicate or not..About 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with depression + anxiety: no biggie.

Some background info:
I don’t think I’m super depressed, but my friends are convinced that I am. I made a plan to kill myself, but haven’t followed through yet.

I have previously promised to tell my friends if I made new plans to kill myself, which I did.
Now, they want me to get hospitalised so that I can “get help,” but the psych ward hasn’t helped me before.


The stuff I need help with:
I promised to “get help” yesterday, but I no longer believe I need much help. They won’t let me rescind my promise, and I desperately don’t want to break it.

I am fairly certain I’m not depressed. Even though I’ve attempted suicide a couple of times, I have ended the attempts on my own before getting hurt.


My question is: should I listen to them and go to the psych ward, or am I justified in believing I can manage on my own?

1761,Does this qualify as depression?,"Recently a pattern in my behavior has become very clear to me. Whenever I don't have a structure in my schedule to keep me busy, out of the house, and socializing, I begin to fall apart.

My hygiene suffers, I sometimes go a week without showering or brushing my teeth. The amount of dry shampoo I use is scary. 

I always end up binging, with food and television. I was doing great all summer with a healthy diet, exercising, losing weight. Then my summer job ended. Now I spend the majority of my time watching show after show and mindlessly eating while I do it.

Whenever im alone in the house and not distracting myself with food, tv, or porn I just end up pacing around, staring out the window melancholically like a antidepressant tv ad.

I've had a therapy consultation at my college where we primarily discussed my potentially having ADHD and my struggles with feeling guilty about my academic underperformance. I might've gotten to talking about whether I'm depressed, but I never actually had a session, they were booked until the end of the year.

I'm just looking for some answers, thinking about trying to find a therapist, but the only local source has had many questionable testimonials.","Does this qualify as depression?Recently a pattern in my behavior has become very clear to me.

1992,Am I depressed? *trigger warning*,"I, 23 (Male) have been feeling weird FOR YEARS. I don't really know if I'm depressed or not because I have never been to therapy and probably never will because It's hella expensive from where I'm from.

I don't want to self-diagnose my 'depression' because I just find that weird and wrong. 

I was 12 when I first harmed myself, I don't think I did it a lot but back then, I just thought I was just influenced with the whole 'emo' phase a lot of people my age then was so into. I had a few attempts growing up, and that's when I started thinking maybe I really am depressed, because even If i didn't do 'it' constantly throughout the years since I first did it, there would be days where I thought dying would just be the best option because I felt so shitty all the time.

I googled the symptoms of depression as I grew older and would relate to most of it, BUT i still could not find myself to think that I am depressed since I have not even checked in with a professional.

Today, I have been feeling so bad about everything, I could explain In details about my life but It won't be necessary for this post. Some days there's a reason for me to be sad, and some days I just don't know what's the root of my sadness. I would just feel like shit even though I had a great day, and I could never really point out WHY i'm sad and it frustrates me until I cry and just try to exhaust myself and sleep and hope that I feel better when I wake up.

Someone, please help, I really don't know what I could do anymore. I'm losing my mind and I just want to figure out what's going on with me and I don't think I could keep playing this guessing game with myself for the rest of my life. It makes me feel so miserable.

I don’t know if this is just a need for attention, but  I’d rather not tell my parents not anyone.  I want to fix the problem on my own.

217,"My self care plan, and I'd appreciate some further advice.","Hello everyone,

I'm a 26 year old woman and I suffer from depression. I'm in therapy and on antidepressants. I attempted suicide in April 2018 but, since then, I've made a lot of progress and I'm quite happy with myself. But loneliness is still a major trigger for my depression. Tomorrow I'll leave for another city because I have to participate in a public competition for a workplace (I'm in Italy so, in order to work for the Government, you have to participate to public selections). 

Problem: I don't know anyone in this city so I'll be alone for seven days. Yes, I'll meet other people who apply for the same selection, but at the end of the day I'll return to my hotel room and I'll be alone. And I'm very scared. 

This is my self care plan, that I organized with my therapist:

\- focusing on the public selection;

\- bringing my favourite books;

\- Netflix for the nights;

\- going to fine restaurants and enjoying good food

\- visiting the city in my spare time 

\- calling my SO and/or friends if I really feel overwhelmed 

Do you have any other advice? I'm a bit anxious.

846,A happy lonely girl,"I have a girlfriend and she was diagnosed with clinical depression. She always seems happy, she likes to make corny jokes and we always enjoy each other.
But there will always a day she will tell that she feels alone, that she hates herself that she can't even look herself in the mirror and says that she's a burden to everyone. It really hurts me everytime I hear those words from her. I always try my best to comfort her, even though I'm not with her physically I will talk to her over the phone without hanging out the phone and watch her until she fell asleep because that's the only thing that I can do. 
Worst feeling is I don't know what to do or what to say to cheer her up whenever she feels that extreme sadness. Also even in regular days, she can't accept compliments.
I love her so much that I want to be with her in always. I want to be her shoulder whenever she feel sad. I am not that knowledgeable about how to handle things like this so I'm seeking some tips or anything that can help me help her in her battles.

I always try my best to comfort her, even though I'm not with her physically I will talk to her over the phone without hanging out the phone and watch her until she fell asleep because that's the only thing that I can do. 
Worst feeling is I don't know what to do or what to say to cheer her up whenever she feels that extreme sadness. Also even in regular days, she can't accept compliments.
I love her so much that I want to be with her in always. I want to be her shoulder whenever she feel sad. I am not that knowledgeable about how to handle things like this so I'm seeking some tips or anything that can help me help her in her battles.

1021,Depression meds have killed our sex life. Help.,"Me (M49) and my girlfriend (F39) haven't had sex for nearly 5yrs. She's on meds for depression and this has robbed her of her sex drive.

10,Learning I have Alexithymia really fucked me up.,"I've always accepted the fact that one day I will kill myself. I joke and say I'm going to kill myself every once in awhile. I've always felt empty and just figured that it was Depression and suicidal thoughts. I promised myself when I was little I would kill myself at 21, I'm 23 now, I'm on meds for depression and I go to a psychiatrist, I have a long term girlfriend who I can see a future with. 

However, that doesn't stop the fact that one day I will kill myself. I told my girlfriend I never want children or marriage because when I do kill myself it'd be easier on everyone. I am getting a vasectomy soon so I don't have any dependents, I've pushed people away, no, I forget other people exist because that's how much no one matters to me.

A few days ago I learned that I have Alexithymia, which means I don't feel emotions. I never had a way of explaining how I feel until I found out what Alexithymia was. 

I have no feelings. I can not experience what I assume is one of the best things about being a human. I have no imagination, no creativity. I simply exist and that's it. Imagine playing a game that's in the first person. That's my life, I just see stuff, I don't feel anything. 

Not to be cliché but I am nothing but a shell of a man. 

This really fucked me up, enough where I stare off, I'm not very talkative and I get lost in my head that life truly is pointless. My girlfriend notices and she's kind of worried, she asked if I would be okay by myself before she left for work. 

I feel like this solidified that life is ultimately pointless, especially for me. 

I only see two options: Kill myself or live in the prison that life is.","Learning I have Alexithymia really fucked me up.I've always accepted the fact that one day I will kill myself.

525,My breakup is killing me,"Sorry about the melodramatic title, but this really is what it feels like. I'll try to keep this story short, however I could keep on talking for hours and if someone one this sub was willing to have a talk with me by PMs I'd love to because I'm just so incredibly lonely right now.

About a week ago my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. It was a stupid breakup and I feel like my behaviour is the reason for why we broke up, even though she too made plenty of mistakes. When I lost her I once again realized how much she meant to me and that I didn't want to lose her at any costs so I tried to get her back. But all I got were mean-spirited messages saying how she doesn't miss me, she's realized we're incompatible and that she's glad I moved out.

Some days ago I created a tinder profile because I thought it'd help me get over her. Guess what, first evening on tinder I saw her profile. And it fucking killed me inside. The next days, she would routinely put some nice clothes on and leave, while I was stuck in the living room watching her leave to some tinder gate, and it killed me. That's when I realized I had to leave.. so while she was at work I packed up all my stuff and left, leaving her one last voice message that I can't take the situation and that I still want her back. That's when I got her mean-spirited message.

I feel like she was all I had. People I talk to are telling me to distract myself with things that are fun to me, but frankly, I don't know what's fun to me anymore. Watching tv shows? Gaming? Playing the guitar? I feel like watching shows and gaming are just occupational therapy to me. I used to love playing the guitar, at least I think so, but nowadays I feel so fucking bad whenever I play that it's hard to call it fun either. Sports? I've gained some weight so I decided I wanted to lose \~10kg. That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me (in fact, it's kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup). After that, I trained every day, thinking it'd help me lose weight. But in fact, while I lost \~1.5kg within a week, almost half of that was apparently muscle mass. I found out about that yesterday. Now I don't even want to train anymore.

In the last few weeks, I found myself repeatedly contemplating ""passive"" suicide, as in, it wouldn't be so bad if I drove recklessly and that killed me some day, wouldn't it? Now, I feel like I actually want to die. She had issues, and sometimes those issues really annoyed the hell out of me. But who doesn't have those? I feel stupid for losing her and I feel like I won't ever be able to forgive myself. I was ready to marry this girl, but I lost her, due to my own stupidity. I won't ever find another woman like her again, I know that for certain, and I hate myself for it. I would do anything to get back with her, but she has made it clear that she's not interested in me anymore.

Now I know that she will go on tons of tinder dates, kiss other guys, have sex with other guys, maybe in our shared bed and it's killing me inside. Is it jealousy? Purely hormonal? I hope it is because if this feeling goes on, I think I'm actually going to try something. I'm not in therapy, I know I should be, but my depression is making it hard to actually get a therapist. Not to mention that usually you'll have to wait a few months until there's a vacant spot.

875,Depression make me unable to have deep connection with others,"I am 23 yo female and I have problem having connection with others. I never have close friend that I share my worries or stories to. Never been in relationship and don't know how to open up to anyone. Sometimes I thought that maybe I deserve to be alone and not worthy of anyone time. Even someone that I consider close to me never think the same about me. I feel like if I ever try to be vulnerable with someone it'd be burden to them because they don't actually care about me.
It feel like I've been like this all my life. It's very apparent to people around me how depressed I am, I don't think I have the energy to mask it and this is probably what make people rather not be close to me. 
In this pandemic time it's even more easier for me to feel lonely and thinking every possible worse scenario about the future. I'm helpless and don't know who to share my thought to. I need someone but I don't know how to reach them. My dad is stressed about his business, my mom busy with my younger siblings they are still super young, i don't know where I should turn to.","Depression make me unable to have deep connection with othersI am 23 yo female and I have problem having connection with others.

These things happened before, but this happened in such a unusual way, it normally happens after my ASSHOLE dad pisses me off.

I know this isn't the place to ask about medicine but in case this is more in the psychological side then i need a new perspective on the matter.","Is it normal for medication to make things worse before getting better?I started a new medication yesterday, Fluoxetine in liquid form to be consumed orally after breakfast, i was drawing as usual but suddenly i got memories of stressful moments of my life, which made me incredibly angry, i reached the desire of screaming and punching stuff, haven't break anything thankfully.

1518,Chronic Depression and Work Performance,"Hello. 

I need someone's thoughts or advice. I have several diagnosed illnesses, persistent grieving disorder and pdd (with frequent mdes, so thanks brain for the double depression 😅). I am unmedicaded

In that past couple months after a huge mde I never quite made it completely out and have been progressively doing worse to a point where my work performance is suffering, I've received a couple of warnings to ""get my sh t together"" (not in those exact words but close). I've never been in such a position where my work ability has lacked because of this. Like I genuinely feel like I'm going to either get fired sooner or later or suddenly quit, because of my mental state. 

I am going to discuss with my psychiatrist medication. We had talked about it before but they basically said we could talk more in detail when I was ready. 

But a part of me has been considering temporary disability to basically be able to figure myself out, figure out the right meds if necessary, right dosage, etc before putting myself out there to work. I feel so heavy everytime I get ready for the day like ""what am I going to mess up today"" and its making everything so much worse. My work frustration is literally dragging me down harder. I'm so frustrated with myself and I'm so tired of feeling like this all the time. 

What has everyone here done at work? Has anyone felt like they can't properly perform due to their illness? If so, what have you done about it? What has helped you work wise?","Chronic Depression and Work PerformanceHello.

1442,I need help finding coping mechanisms,"TW- suicide

For most of my life, i'd always been extremely suicidal. I won't go into detail about my life but it sucks and heavily contributed to me having depression and being suicidal since before I even became a teenager. A couple years ago, I had a failed suicide attempt and thanks to the help of some people I managed to actually develop a will to live and I finally got rid of the suicidal part, but I'm still struggling with the depression part.

When I was suicidal, it was really easy for me to handle mental breakdowns by just telling myself ""It's fine. I'll just kill myself, I don't have to worry about the future that much. If things get as bad as I'm fearing they're about to, I have an easy way out."" 

Now, whenever I have mental breakdowns I default to saying the same thing but then I start thinking ""Fuck. I don't want to die, I can't just kill myself. There's no way out of this."" and my mental breakdown continues and gets worse.

I'm really struggling with handling mental breakdowns. Even when I try to distract myself, either I fail to be distracted and keep overthinking, or it just pushes the breakdown further down the line and the moment I stop being distracted I fall back into the breakdown. I'm trying to stay away from substance abuse. It works, but I want to stay healthy and I have personal experience with the dangers of substance abuse. I've tried depression medication before but none of them really helped me much. I'm considering therapy, but I'm too anxious that revealing I used to be suicidal might make them worry I'm currently suicidal and result in a psych ward situation. I don't know what to do anymore to cope, google doesn't really help, it's hard.

A clarification just in case, I'm seriously not suicidal. I will not be killing myself. I don't need people spamming the comments telling me why I should stay alive, I just need help finding coping mechanisms please.","I need help finding coping mechanismsTW- suicide

And her husband lost his second job. So the house couldnt be payed for and was a liquid asset. My mom had been applying for Disability since shes been the victim of domestic violence with all 3 of her marriges. But since we barely moved to Virgina everything was still based in Idaho. Food Stamps, Medicaid, and goverment records and stuff. So she needed to move back to Idaho and quick. But it took us a month to get to Virginia and cost $3000. We sold our car. So the whole time in virginia I payed for internet, phone plans, and storage back in Idaho with a job at Mcdonald's with no transportation. So we couldnt afford a move back. But a wonderful old friend of my moms back in Idaho that had been housing my brother this whole time decided to pay for a plane ticket back to Idaho for my mom and house her too. So she paid for that and my mom just barely paid her back with tax returns. But right before my mom left I moved to a different town in Virginia I decided to save her money by living on my own with the money I had saved. It has been good for 2 months rent.

But I woke up today .. and I just... cleaned... and cleaned.. and cleaned.. like the entire house. I just kept going like I had an I infinite amount of energy. Dishes, laundry, mop, swept, vacuumed, ect. I just kept going and going and going all day long. Like wtf is wrong me?! I'm so confused!!!

204,"I followed the plan, and everything sucks.","So, I was a good kid, got good grades, went to uni, graduated with a good degree, met a good man, married, and had kids.  I fell out of love with my chosen career, and so bounced from job to job before my husband and I decided I would stay at home with the kids.

Since then, we’ve moved far away from our friends and family - for husband’s work, and I do like living here - but I have lost almost all my friends, and since my parents died, no one in my family really talks to me any more.  My kids were never much involved in any school activities, so I never made friends with other moms.  Our neighbors never seem to leave their homes.

When my youngest graduated, I decided I wanted to go back to work.  My health threw me a roadblock or two, so I didn’t really start looking until February.  I reworked my CV/resume, and began applying.  Nothing.

A few years ago, my husband started what might be called a mid-life crisis.  He wants to open our marriage, and while we tabled these discussions because of things we’re dealing with, including financial struggles, he has started bringing it up again.

So, I basically don’t have a family, have very few friends, my health isn’t great, I don’t have the money to fix/replace/buy things that are needed, can’t get a call - let alone an interview - for a job, and my husband - who has been my rock up until now - is angry and resentful because I don’t want to talk about opening our marriage right now.

I followed the plan, and now I hate my life.  Getting a job would help so much, but my degree is old and my experience is old, and no one wants me.  I feel useless and awful.  These are office jobs; husband and I agreed other jobs would not work because of health issues mostly, lower pay secondly.

I have no one to talk to - friends aren’t that close; family dead or won’t talk to me; can’t afford therapy - so I am venting here.  If anyone read this far, thank you.","I followed the plan, and everything sucks.So, I was a good kid, got good grades, went to uni, graduated with a good degree, met a good man, married, and had kids.

1007,The days have nothing to offer for me: Looking for projects or hobbies to ease depression,"Hey girls and guys,

I'm suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. Today I'm 21. My symptoms are mainly anhedonia (disinterest and joylessness), lack of drive, motivation and ability to get stimulated, painful negative thoughts starting right in the morning when I open my eyes (about past, present, future, that I don't have anything to offer, that I'm disabled, that future life has nothing to offer for me etc.), lethargy, low mood, sadness, cognitive restrictions (memory, focus, access to knowledge and thoughts) and irrational social anxiety.

I wake up and see nothing that waits on me, nothing that I wait for or am up to or interested in, no drive or motivation to stand up, nothing that drives me (anhedonia again). I then think what reasons or motives do other ""normal"" people see when waking up? I feel so empty about what the day has for me. Only thing I can see is food, maybe. Even food is no drive for me, I don't eat that much and don't feel the need to eat, I suffer from lack of appetite due to depression.

Sure, I don't have much self worth or confidence at all. I don't have many things I'm passionate about or I'm good in. I see the connection: no things you're passionate (drive) or good at (feelings of success giving self worth) =&gt; depression. I still do things. I have a side job, not quite good in it. I study psychology, 5th semestre already, not quite good in it. As already mentioned my cognition turned incredibly bad, I always think I'm dumb and unable to follow conversations, intellectual topics and such. Studying and university tasks or contents are very hard for me. I play tennis but rarely, quite good in it. I used to go to the gym, was boring but still quite good for distraction and feelings of success. I produce digital music, quite good in it and makes fun when I have a good day. I would love to play tennis and visit the gym more often but 1. they all contain socializing as there are people, so my social anxiety makes it incredibly hard for me and 2. now there is Corona. Other things like academic aspects, going deeper into a topic, studying neuro science or pharmacology (esp. neuroscience was a love of mine, I spent a lot of time with it and it was the reason for me starting the bachelor in psychology) is almost impossible for me because depression makes me dumb, disabled and very restricted in thinking or making.

I'm sorry for the long text. Thanks to everyone who read until here. What are your thoughts?

Do you have experience with this and somehow managed to improve the situation and feelings?

Do you have ideas for projects or hobbies I could try to get into and maybe find a passion in to kill my feelings of emptiness, negative thoughts and self worth issues? I would be happy about any idea, anything, that's somehow manageable even when being depressed and socially anxious. Something I can hold onto, improve in and get feelings of success and self worth or skill. Something that distracts me from negative thoughts and psychological pain of depression.

Have a nice day, I wish you the best! &lt;3","The days have nothing to offer for me: Looking for projects or hobbies to ease depressionHey girls and guys,

They say it's fine and they care but I can tell that they find it uncomfortable.

I have been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. I have often theorized if therapy could help but actually going there was always out of question (for a variety of reasons). 

I have read what therapy is supposed to give you (no cure, but a more endurable existence?) but never how one goes about the whole thing. How do you choose a therapist? Do you just walk in and just start talking about all the bad things?

414,Are depression and anhedonia part of getting older?,"Most of my post pubescent life I have dealt with depression, but it's only gotten more frequent and more extreme as I've gotten older.

Lately I've been experiencing total anhedonia, where my favorite game, movie, music don't make me feel anything at all. Hanging out with friends is almost exhausting, and I have to fake being positive and laughing, etc. 

Is this just part of growing up? Is it time to finally start devoting my time to purely practical things? Joy is just for children and young adults?

1689,Let's be realistic,"I stand at the gateway between being stuck in my head and living in reality. You could imagine it like an arched doorway, about 12 feet tall. The door itself is made of rocks, placed almost like bars. The support frame is metal, cold, blue. On the inside, behind the door, it's cold, it's empty, it's black. Filled with images if the past, things that I regret, pain, scars. There are two chains on the floor, not far from where I stand. Those chains were what I used to rattle to summon or conjure back the moments I feel I missed. Like opportunities that had passed me by, like love lost by the way side, like all the memories I just can't seem to let go, like all the people I've lost along this road. 

But on the other side there is a light that's beaming bright. I can feel the warmth of the air brush my sides and I feel the urge to come running. Like it's calling out my name, like I no longer need to be ashamed of who I am today, like everything I've ever known has a chance to change.

But my biggest struggle is in letting go. My biggest fear of losing control, yet I just need to find my way home, I don't want to be trapped here forever, inside the cold, growing abyss. Reminiscing all the opportunities I missed. I don't want to die here alone, yet I'm so afraid to move forward, as I navigate this dark night of the soul.

Sometimes it's hard enough just to breathe, as I feel the light taking over me. All the damage hidden underneath brought to life, im forced to see and the well behind my eyes, it opens up, it opens wide. I can feel the tears stuck behind of all the pain I've forced myself to hide.

So I speak to you in riddles, could it be I'm just a boy inside? I know I'm stuck here in the middle, too afraid to step into the light.","Let's be realisticI stand at the gateway between being stuck in my head and living in reality.

For the past three or four years I've been struggling with major depressive spells but this most recent one has been going on since March of last year and it's really taking its toll. I'm living with my abusive parents who constantly remind me of how shitty I am, college is a no-go because of my finances and performance in high school, and I don't really have an outlet to find friends. None of the people I have in my life seem to care at all about my mental or physical health and only want me around when they're feeling down or lonely. I feel like I'm a side character in my own story and haven't wanted to live for a while now. Last night I came the closest I ever have to suicide but I just barely didn't have the guts to do it. I remember how being happy felt and I want that again but I don't have insurance nor the money for medicine. I was in a mental hospital once when I was younger as I was having suicidal thoughts but I don't remember anything about it, really.

815,I am depressed and I lost all of my friends. I feel so alone.,"For my entire life, I have dealt with severe persistent depression (dysthymia as the diagnosis) and anxiety. I have gone through a lot of stuff, especially toxic friendships throughout life. These past few months have been especially tough for me. I got involved in a ""relationship"" that didn't end up in a relationship due to his and my own mental instability. He refused to work together on it and trying to work on some things we both had issues with. This made me feel as if he didn't really care about me. Tonight he told me he definitely did not have romantic feelings for me anymore. After that, my best friend (Let's call her Katie) contacted me for help involving her struggling with suicidal thoughts (not necessarily wanting to kill herself, more so that the thought of suicide made her anxious). Anyways, after I helped her to the best of my ability, I felt great. (I want to be a therapist so this is rewarding to me if I can help anyone.) But then, she told me something. I have had this other friend for a long long time. (Let's call her Amy) Throughout high school, Amy and I had issues because her mother absolutely despised me and created issues for our friendship. I am pretty sure she blamed a lot of stuff on me to her mom so she wouldn't get in trouble for it. As a result, I began getting left out of our friend group a lot and was treated like an outcast. She has been a pretty shitty friend to me. Last year, Amy moved away to go to a different college, which made things so much easier for me, life was going great. But this summer she moved back to town and is transferring to our hometown college. Immediately life started going back to how it used to be. Katie hangs out with them a ton and I am just alone and don't really get invited. I ended up saying something to Katie and asked her if she thinks everyone is going to start excluding me again and I said something like, ""Since Amy moved back, everyone flocks to her like she is crack"". This is not a great thing to say but I was frustrated and panicking at the time. Katie was with Amy and another girl at the time, and I thought Katie wouldn't show anyone and this was a private convo (my mistake for thinking that would be true). Tonight, after feeling the gratification of helping her, Katie decided to tell me that the other girl she was with and Amy read what I said. I genuinely didn't say anything super mean, just that I was frustrated that as soon as she moves back, I get dropped. Katie told me the other girl she was with said: ""that is just disrespectful and out of line"". and Amy said, ""I'm glad I know how she really feels about me"". Sorry for the long story but now, I just feel like nothing. I feel that I mess up every friendship. But at the same time, I am frustrated with the fact that if they do anything to hurt me, it means nothing, but if I do anything I am automatically this horrible human being. They act as if they have done nothing to me. I left my group message with all my friends, which was my main source of support and I stopped talking to the boy who finally told me he has lost all romantic feelings for me. (He talked to me every day for about a month after he ""ended things"" and said he still had feelings for me for the longest time). I feel so alone and like I have hit rock bottom once again. I feel suicidal but I know myself enough to know I won't do anything. I don't want to die; I want the pain and hurt to stop. I just wish people would care for me the amount I care for them. I wish people actually understand that they hurt me and, not to be self-centered, but put themselves in my shoes for just a second.","I am depressed and I lost all of my friends.

I am 30y woman and i am struggling with depression. Yesterday while i was helping my father he yelled at me in the most agreesive type, and got me informed that i need to be obedient, because i am not a 50 y like him. While i was driving, and he was constantly telling me i am a loser. And he always tells me that because i have no job, cause the pandemic, i have to do whatever they want because i cannot afford to pay. He told me that this is how he loves me (while being aggressive). I was so terrified and scared because we could cause an accident. While he does not have a driving license, he sais driving is simple and is for stupid ppl. And he treats me like i am a cab driver, telling me where to go... I asked him while driving and trying to focus on the road, why does he treat me like this. Always when i ask questions, no one answers. He constantly commands and yells at everyone in the house, and he always tries to proof that he knows shit.... I was terrified because he could smack me while i was driving. I went in a shock, while i was home, i cried so much, my self esteem is down. And something in me died yesterday. I am a good person and stayed out of trouble, worked. But even when i paid things in the house, or if i helped them constanlty, didn't matter je would treat me the same. Nothing satisfies him. All my life yelled and threatened me in various scenarios like school things, even if he didn't stayed with me and never involving in my after school homework, to pressuring me about exams and threaten me of i dont pass, i will end up being garbage man. He is so mediocre, no involvement but he is the bigger stupid mouth, no communication, no empathy. I am a small meaninglessness human being in his eyes.
Why is he fucking mean. I feel pain. I cry, i seek help. My mom does another shit thing. If i report to her what i did she victimises herself despite the fact she wasn't there, and what i say is simply my fault, because i need to shut up and execute.

Pretty much my entire life they did this. I feel scared, i have anxiety towards them, if i wont do something they will share with me their mean thoughts about me.

248,"I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days.","I need help.

17 year old male, 18 beginning of July. 

I've been struggling with my mental health for all of my life, and it got worse after starting puberty. 

I've always been terrible with social groups and interactions. Never managed to make a lot of friends, and those I did never sticked. Had some of your regular trauma from parents and older brother. 

I've always felt alone.

When I became a teenager I started with the depression. Got very bad episodes, where I would shut down, and fake illness so I could stay home. I missed one month of school once, and on a trip to Italy for school I faked illness for two weeks so I could stay in bed, and could only think about jumping off a bridge.

As I got deeper into adolescence not only did my mental health deteriorate, but my ability too. My memory became poor, and my focus was gone, always having mental fog. I couldn't remember words, and speak eloquently. Math ability went to the shitter, always making stupid mistakes that would then seem retarded later. 

My IQ seemed to have dropped as much as 10 points, since I have periodically been applied tests and only perform worse. 

Starting high school made me much more suicidal because of this, and the isolation of not knowing anyone, and the people I did know wouldn't even look me in the eyes. 

I had already gone to a psychologist, and after that a neurologist, and recently a therapist.

Got medication, and have been on it since 2017. The doctor has changed my meds more times than I can count, and none of them have helped. She told me that I would probably never be off of meds, but they still don't help me. I have no cure.

I feel I have been slowly getting worse, going down my own dark little hole. 

I've always been obsessive, but now it feels like it's all I am. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Everything makes me irritated, or break down. Noise seemed to be the problem. Voices make me go mad, but even when I'm alone and in silence I keep thinking about everything needing to shut up. The chatter is all inside my head, and it never stops. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like sometimes I am already dead on the inside, and I'm not really human. Just a shell o what I wanted to be. 

I started going out to party's and things, mostly just filling myself with alcohol, or I'll just drive around going as fast as I can. Hoping I'll be something else, hoping I'll feel.

I've had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldn't feel anything for anyone (and no, not even her). I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didn't feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her. The meds make me worse off. My sex drive is completely dead. 

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of high school I have made some friends, but I end up isolating myself, and losing them.

I'm starting college in August, and I'll move to another city for that, but I fear that will only isolate me, and make me worse. I think that if I don't kill myself soon, I'll do it then. I see no real future past a certain point. 

I fear it'll all colapse, and I'll truly break down. I fear I'll lose interest in my career, since it has already happened. I was going to study astrophysics, but after an episode I saw nothing in that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going crazy, always suffering. Everyday is pain, and I just want it to end. I am sick. 

I contemplate suicide everyday, but what ultimately stops me is just the possibility of a failed attempt, and getting scarred for many years to come, and always under watchful eyes after the attempt. 

The hurdle of death is my prison.","I'm losing my mind and need help. I contemplate suicide everyday. I don't see any future anymore, just think I'll kill myself one of these days.I need help.

668,How should I do this 'homework' from a therapist,"Hello,

I am struggling with some pieces of 'homework' between sessions that the counsellor has given me. These are the tasks:

1.) Call my friends and tell them how I feel.

2.) Ask 10 people to describe me in three words.

I'm struggling with both of these because:

* I'm a 26-year-old man. I was not brought up to have - much less talk about - feelings. Sure, trying to break that sounds great in theory but one of my friend group tried that a year or two ago and none of us knew what to say or do at all. We felt so awkward and just left it. Some of our friend group just said this guy had had a few bad days and was blowing it out of proportion- not nasty but none of us know how to handle it. Family are out of the question sadly as they always become very angry with me for mentioning feelings
* Telling friends I feel bad during a coronavirus pandemic is *incredibly* selfish- we've all got problems
* It would also be proving them right- they've been hassling me contsantly to come home (even though it'd be illegal to socialise with them in person anyway RN, so kinda pointless). I've told them I feel better away from my parents for a bit longer, plus I can work on an essay I'm writing for uni. I live in a student area and students don't seem to be panic-buying like other groups, so i just feel more comfortable here. Saying I feel bad (despite feeling this way for 15 years-ish) would just increase their feelings that I ought to move in with the parents. I'm vehenmently against this
* I know it sounds like I'm being critical and just shitting on the counsellor's ideas, but I don't think I'm going to be able ot do these tasks
* I'm worried about disappointing the counsellor. We've had two sessions and at the end of each he has asked me what I found most useful and because I'm not really sure what to say I just say the first thing that comes to mind. We talked for 20 minutes about problems I've had about my appearance and being bullied for being ugly for aroun 15 years now and he seemed to think by the end of the conversation that I was healed. Some of what he said maybe will help, but I still have a long way to go (just FYI I'm not expecting counselling to 'cure' me I just need strategies and I desperately just want someone to share stuff with)
* I'm struggling with a lot of the tasks during sessions too- last time I had to fill in a picture of a flower- one positive thing I could do instead of being depressed (it's a choice?) in each petal. I tried hard to overcome the immense \*cringe\* I wanted to react with but I just feel like I'm being picky.
* He said for the second task to tell the people I ask it's for a uni project. I really appreciate this as a cobver-up but I just don't think it'll wash. Anyone male in my family would cringe like mad at being asked to describe another guy in three words, and my mates, well... you expect a group of lads to give serious answers to that (their sense of humour is appreciated, it just wouldn't make this task possible)? 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to disappoint the therapist- I already struggle to know what the correct answer is to his questions during sessions, and I can tell he thinks I'm weird. I desperately want to get better - this has been going in since I was 10 - and I've tried counselling twice before. I was going to try medication (which all counsellors I've met have told me not to, but with no reasons given) but can't now as the health servcie is so overworked right now.

Also there is one thing I want to discuss with the counsellor really badly (sexual abuse when I was a child, sorry if TMI), but he said in our first meeting that it's an ethics violation. I can't afford a proper counsellor (this is free through uni- I'm aware how priviledged I am and I am sorry that I'm just complaining) so I'd appreciate any advice on how I could work through this.

Thank you, and sorry again that I am complaining.","How should I do this 'homework' from a therapistHello,

* I'm a 26-year-old man. I was not brought up to have - much less talk about - feelings. Sure, trying to break that sounds great in theory but one of my friend group tried that a year or two ago and none of us knew what to say or do at all. We felt so awkward and just left it. Some of our friend group just said this guy had had a few bad days and was blowing it out of proportion- not nasty but none of us know how to handle it. Family are out of the question sadly as they always become very angry with me for mentioning feelings
* Telling friends I feel bad during a coronavirus pandemic is *incredibly* selfish- we've all got problems
* It would also be proving them right- they've been hassling me contsantly to come home (even though it'd be illegal to socialise with them in person anyway RN, so kinda pointless). I've told them I feel better away from my parents for a bit longer, plus I can work on an essay I'm writing for uni. I live in a student area and students don't seem to be panic-buying like other groups, so i just feel more comfortable here. Saying I feel bad (despite feeling this way for 15 years-ish) would just increase their feelings that I ought to move in with the parents. I'm vehenmently against this
* I know it sounds like I'm being critical and just shitting on the counsellor's ideas, but I don't think I'm going to be able ot do these tasks
* I'm worried about disappointing the counsellor. We've had two sessions and at the end of each he has asked me what I found most useful and because I'm not really sure what to say I just say the first thing that comes to mind. We talked for 20 minutes about problems I've had about my appearance and being bullied for being ugly for aroun 15 years now and he seemed to think by the end of the conversation that I was healed. Some of what he said maybe will help, but I still have a long way to go (just FYI I'm not expecting counselling to 'cure' me I just need strategies and I desperately just want someone to share stuff with)
* I'm struggling with a lot of the tasks during sessions too- last time I had to fill in a picture of a flower- one positive thing I could do instead of being depressed (it's a choice?) in each petal. I tried hard to overcome the immense \*cringe\* I wanted to react with but I just feel like I'm being picky.
* He said for the second task to tell the people I ask it's for a uni project. I really appreciate this as a cobver-up but I just don't think it'll wash. Anyone male in my family would cringe like mad at being asked to describe another guy in three words, and my mates, well... you expect a group of lads to give serious answers to that (their sense of humour is appreciated, it just wouldn't make this task possible)? 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to disappoint the therapist- I already struggle to know what the correct answer is to his questions during sessions, and I can tell he thinks I'm weird. I desperately want to get better - this has been going in since I was 10 - and I've tried counselling twice before. I was going to try medication (which all counsellors I've met have told me not to, but with no reasons given) but can't now as the health servcie is so overworked right now.

Also there is one thing I want to discuss with the counsellor really badly (sexual abuse when I was a child, sorry if TMI), but he said in our first meeting that it's an ethics violation. I can't afford a proper counsellor (this is free through uni- I'm aware how priviledged I am and I am sorry that I'm just complaining) so I'd appreciate any advice on how I could work through this.

Thank you, and sorry again that I am complaining.",rap home hell work therapist homework ion ask end friend my_friend fee feel my_friends people ask year old_man year_old man feeling fee talk feel sound end non eat friend new group year my_friend left war end non bad_days friend group day days ion illegal legal question angry end home fish virus red poi friend problem son right feeling fee feel family men social ion my_parents bit longer writing rent fee feel work comfort area buy group panic fee feel live student pit increase year rent feeling fee feel sound poi ink ask men think end ask mind ion conversation end problem ink year talk lie appearance ion think tea selling positive ice depressed time help press choice ask ion pet fee feel men people ask ink think humour lad possible group male family ask my_family mate well question rap poi ink therapist ion think selling ice alt reason health son right cat work medication ion bus sex meeting discuss abuse meet child ethics ion war ice ford ged free work advice thank_you,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'no'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'no'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]"

1934,"Vent: It's hard watching all my friends get married, travel the world, and accomplish big things while my own life is going nowhere."," 

I just feel so damn lonely. I'm broke, depressed, and my life isn't going anywhere. Why is everything so hard?

I'm trying to escape the rut I'm in but it's an uphill battle. It's hard   for me to hold down a consistent job, still be creative and productive, and not want to yeet myself every day. I just don't get it...maybe I  hit  the Unlucky Lottery?

There's a   part of me that just gets sadder when I see posts from my friends   showing off their engagement rings or the places they've traveled. I'm   not supposed to feel that way so I try to ignore it, but the emotion   becomes so overwhelming that I can no longer ignore it. I'm supposed to be happy for them. I should stop wallowing in pity. An unspoken pitfall of depression is that you can become quite self-absorbed.

I'd love to be in a relationship, but not many people want to date the  mentally ill guy--which I guess is reasonable. Another shitty thing is  that my religion teaches you're not even allowed to *think* about sex before marriage, which makes my life so much harder now that I associate every urge I have with guilt.

What am I to do? Just continue suffering without any hope of a better life? Why?

Fuck me, man.","Vent: It's hard watching all my friends get married, travel the world, and accomplish big things while my own life is going nowhere.

   I've been helping my friends through their mental issues with positive affirmations and hope for the future. But its a lie, I dont believe anyone has a future, life sucks then we die. Sometimes I feel bad for trying to keep them from killing themselves, as I believe they will be happier that way.  I don't want to think this but I've never seen anyone live a happy life. 
I need support , sadly from redditors, because  I dont think my friends can handle anything negative rn.
  


Rant

  I probably think this way because as a child I watched my family overwork themselves, working multiple jobs to support me and my siblings, just to go home and be miserable. Mental illness kept them from being happy as a child, they never had the time to be happy as an adult, and being elderly is driving them to madness. My family has high expectations for me but I dont see the point. Its not like having a good job or money will make me happy. Mental illness has stolen my youth, ill overwork myself as an adult to eventually retire to a life of feeling that I wasted away.","I've been lying about having hopeI just need advice.

974,Everything Feels Too Overwhelming,"I feel overwhelmed at the slightest things. This has been happening for a long, long time but it just keeps getting worse. Some days are better than others. Today is a bad day.

I quite my job in January to “live my dream” of being a full-time artist. I am failing so hard. Yes, COVID really impacted everything but if I’m being completely honest, I was never cut out for this to begin with. I’ve taken on commissioned work that is months overdue because the thought of starting is so overwhelming. I keep telling myself, “tomorrow I will start” and I feel relieved.

I wanted to make art today (first time in months) and even got excited at the idea of going to the art store, but then I just thought “it will just be another piece that sits there and goes unfinished”. I killed all of my excitement before I even did anything. This isn’t me. I used to love to create art more than anything and spent almost every spare second painting.

I haven’t started and I feel guilt and shame everyday. I feel stuck. I can’t start and I feel like absolute shit for my behaviour.

I also “run” an online vintage shop. I built the new website back in February and was SO proud and excited about it. I haven’t touched it since. I want to, I want to work on it, but now I have SO many pieces of clothing that need to be cleaned, photographed, listed, measured, that it’s- again....overwhelming. I can’t bring myself to start and just look at all the beautiful clothing just sitting there every single day.

Some days I scroll through my phone for hours because I’m looking for a sign or a solution. I’m wasting my life. I hate feeling this way. I hate living this way. I’m unhappy no matter what I do and I’m feeling SO much guilt for letting so many people down. 

I’m 30 years old- too old to be acting this way. It’s so shameful. I also keep thinking that it’s too late for me to make any changes. What’s the point in trying to do better if I haven’t already figured it out by now. I’ve been feeling this way for at least 2 years and keep waiting for some magical answer that will turn everything around.

Again, I have good days too but today isn’t one of them. Thanks for letting me vent.","Everything Feels Too OverwhelmingI feel overwhelmed at the slightest things. This has been happening for a long, long time but it just keeps getting worse. Some days are better than others. Today is a bad day.

855,How to stop feeling so tired all the time?,"Quarantine has been rough on me so far. It's practically been undoing months of therapy for me.

I don't know how to stop feeling so exhausted from not doing anything. It's hard for me to even pick up my iPad to work on my illustrations. I have a hard time even thinking about getting up and I end up taking an unnecessary nap. My whole life I would hang out in my bed because there wasn't anywhere else for me to be due to my living situation. 

And even now that I'm living with my boyfriend l still have a hard time getting up because I'm just so fucking tired and depressed, I just want to sleep forever until this pandemic is over.

1996,I haven’t been myself since 2020. Will I ever go back to normal or should I just give up on life?,"
I was a straight A college student and part time EMT. Now I’m an unemployed college dropout living at my parents’ house. I gained 40 pounds and stopped enjoying my usual activities. 

I feel like I go from doctor to doctor and none of them give a shit about any of this. The depression started very suddenly in January of 2021 and it’s gotten progressively worse ever since then. Things completely spiraled out of control in October because that’s when I distanced myself from all of my friends. 

I’ve been on 20mg lexapro for several years and I just switched to trintellix a month ago. But… Trintellix makes me feel awful. If anything, I’m worse off than I was before. I have slight brain fog constantly. I have emotions again, which is good, but they’re all negative. I’m just sad and angry 24/7. 

I went to the doctor again today because they said I had “minor hypothyroidism” the last few times I got blood work done. Hopefully I’ll get medicated for that. I just feel powerless. 

I’m like a victim of my own mind. Before this very sudden bout of depression, I was so happy and excited about life. Now it’s as if I have no future because I can’t control my depression and no one is helping me to do so. 

I haven’t been myself since 2020. I don’t know what to do. 

Side note:
I started taking adderall in January and that’s when I started getting depressed. Any correlation?","I haven’t been myself since 2020. Will I ever go back to normal or should I just give up on life?

1763,Sometimes the worst part isn't what happened to us but being alone with the pain from what happened to us,"I've had a crisis today from a breakdown/tantrum in front of my parents and it's late into the night that my friends who would've normally supported me are asleep and also all crisis phone or text lines are especially understaffed around this time.

I don't use suicide hotlines or access &amp; crisis phone lines or text lines anymore all those things that my former therapists recommend because of how many times I've felt worse afterwards or been hung up on dealing with someone who's already numbed and burned out themselves. I get it, the mental healthcare system is understaffed and underfunded and the therapists I've had, it's just been so disappointing and regressive to my health. 

It's just like the classic conditioning example: if you shock a mouse enough times everytime it tries to eat food, it'll be too afraid to eat even when the threat is long gone.

Rarely are people seeking for advice and answers, most times people just want to be seen and heard and feel supported. 

I got angry at my mom for sharing some news with my brother on the phone, which was something she was talking highly of me for but nonetheless I felt very angry because I despise my brothers for how much they've ruined my life and I had a tantrum in front of my parents because I was reminded of the last time my brother rubbed it in my face of my depression and financial situation when we fought and despite my mom giving him good news of mine he'll probably use that to mock me with when I'm back to a poorer financial situation again.

I'm hurt and angry and also guilty that I got angry at my mom who was just trying to talk highly of me but I very much want nothing to do with my brothers. I've had a terrible relationship with my negligent parents all my life and I'm fortunate that they actually feel guilty and sorry about all that and have been genuinely trying to help me now. I spent some money on something helpful for my mom that she very much uses and loves because I'm grateful for her help which was what she was talking about and after getting angry at her but expressing it in an unhealthy way I feel like shit.

It doesn't feel the same trying to vent online, because I want my female friends that I know and care about and feel a genuine connection with to make me feel heard and listened to, and always starting from zero talking to strangers and trying to provide context about who I am and the dexterity of my mental illness is exhausting. I'm a very supportive and helpful person to my said friends when it comes to mental health problems, and having to be on the receiving end and in need of help at inconvenient times just sucks.

In the past I've posted to reddit and people will look at my post history saying ""you are a very mentally ill person and should get help."" And I wish I could just say that ""most of us mentally ill people don't have to luxury to afford anything that actually can help."" And we'll have to take what little opportunities we can get even if it's not ideal or in the least helpful. Lonely people don't have the luxury to choose who can comfort them.

I still feel the lump in my throat and ache in my chest from a crisis and breakdown but at least I've expressed myself","Sometimes the worst part isn't what happened to us but being alone with the pain from what happened to usI've had a crisis today from a breakdown/tantrum in front of my parents and it's late into the night that my friends who would've normally supported me are asleep and also all crisis phone or text lines are especially understaffed around this time.

1897,Could a vitamin D deficiency be causing depression entirely?,"I've been severely depressed and suicidal for well over a year at this point, but I've noticed that it started easing a bit around March/April (the start of winter in my country) and then worsening again in August/September (the start of summer), while I was actually happy in June and July, and any moments of suicidal ideation were anxiety driven, not depression. 


In winter, because it's cold, I spend most of the day lazing in the sun (yes, I know skin cancer, but I don't care), so about 4-5 hours of consistent sunlight at least. In summer, I stay out of the sun entirely because it's too hot and I absolutely hate the heat.

So this makes me think that something is particularly bad in summer to make me significantly more depressed than winter. Perhaps that's a vitamin D deficiency.

Has that been the case for anyone else?","Could a vitamin D deficiency be causing depression entirely?I've been severely depressed and suicidal for well over a year at this point, but I've noticed that it started easing a bit around March/April (the start of winter in my country) and then worsening again in August/September (the start of summer), while I was actually happy in June and July, and any moments of suicidal ideation were anxiety driven, not depression.

1028,"My depression has been so bad, no one has tried to contact me for months to check up and it tears me apart","I have never been on reddit before but I'm at my whits end on trying to find some sort of engagement with people online due to months of isolation and severe depression, because I feel I can't contain anymore of my sadness and loneliness. I have tried free online depression chat rooms and such but, really, I just need someone to tell me I matter. I don't know how this tends to work on Reddit but this is probably just going to be me venting. 

This year my depression has been so bad that my pessimism and slow bitterness and resentment with the world and everyone around me has scared me. I'm scared of how much I have internally changed as a person, my lack of empathy and willingness to care about others, and that has never been my character. This has never been shown through my actions, but I can feel this pessimism and bitterness poisining me internally. I have lost faith in everything, and because of that I eventually stopped coming online on social media altogether for months, both to deal with myself but also because I didn't want to end up acting toxic. I felt (and still do now) that no one cares about me, everyone is busy with their lives and their friends. I may have ""friends"", but they have THEIR friends who they give more attention to.  I have been online and have had ""friends"" or mutuals online who have known me for years, but I have always felt i simply cannot fit with them as they share a bigger bond with eachother. I've just always been a nice, familiar presence that they will interact with regularly. But I have always had experiences of feeling left and felt like I do not matter as much. This applies to real life experiences to. People who just stop making the effort to contact me, under no particular circumstances or conflict. I have always struggled to make friends, and the only long distance friendship I had for over nine years also resulted in stopping contact from their part this beginning of the year. Everytime I've felt that my relationship with a person is stable and we connect and have known eachother for years, I get proven wrong. I now naturally feel intense instibility in friendships, or seeking out friendships in general, because I now expect people to already have a circle of close friends, and I can't be apart of that. And it keeps happening, even online mutual friends have not reached out to me despite seeing my personal posts and how much of a hard time I've been having this year. Even me disappearing for months did nothing. 

I feel intensely stupid and selfish, while at the same time feeling like if I had killed myself during these months of such bad depression, life would resume and no one would know. I feel stupid and selfish because I absolutely know its not people's responsibility to worry about me, especially when they are living their lives and are probably going through their own issues, and I shouldn't be throwing my frustration and bitterness on people. But it feels I've been just left in the dark while online mutuals who have known me for years, continue to enjoy their interactions with eachother and pretend nothing is happening unless they want to engage in a post thats not a personal one. 

There's a lot of different issues in my life which have contributed to my diagnosis of depression and anxiety, but this year it feels like God wants to keep telling me no one cares for you. Til this day I don't know how people make lifelong friendships with people you have so much history and connection with. Maybe because of my own insecurities and outlook on friendships, I'm simply expecting something that normally isn't how it works. I just feel so suffocated whenever I'm online, its like I want to scream at everyone and say ""LOOK AT ME PLEASE, IM SUFFERING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS"" and for never paying attention when I suffered so much and continue to suffer, but want to interact with me on posts that are not about my personal mental health. What happened to making sure everyones okay? Do I not matter enough? Are they just sick and tired of me now? I can't even reach out in this kind of situation because again, I shouldn't be demanding people think about me.

I just wish my headspace wasn't so messed up. Recently, I anticipated that going back online and mentioning my suicide attempt would cause at least some kind of reaction from these mutuals, but nothing actually did happen. Since then I have completely shut down and cant function when I need to the most (exam season), its all just bad timing. But I'm more angry at myself because I basically asked for this, and when I didn't get the reaction I wanted I caused my own downfall. I know that I've caused my own isolation, my depression wants me to push people away so badly, and when I see people not making an effort on their side, people who I felt they would, its just tearing me apart. I really, really just want to disappear. I feel horrible for wanting people to feel guilty, but I'm so exhausted of feeling this way and I only want to be bitter and angry at the world.","My depression has been so bad, no one has tried to contact me for months to check up and it tears me apartI have never been on reddit before but I'm at my whits end on trying to find some sort of engagement with people online due to months of isolation and severe depression, because I feel I can't contain anymore of my sadness and loneliness.

769,I’m just tired and want to feel nothing,"I’ve never done a reddit post or anything before but essentially I’ve been depressed for over 10+ years (20 now) and I’m just really tired. 

For a brief summary I’ve always struggled with family (dad I don’t get along with is an arse, mom who is mentally unstable herself but is in denial and is far to kind to the point that it hurts everyone (the type to constantly be ripped off but to do the exact same thing again and again), ex-step dad who made false promises and has gone off the edge of the earth, ex-step mom whose a 14yr bitchy girl stuck inside a women’s body, older sister who is very over opinionated and it’s her way or the high way and a little sister who is young enough that she’s missed most the trauma but I don’t get to see often because she lives with my dad) I don’t want to get into it because it’s a long story that has lasted all my life. I’ve always really struggled with friends. I find it really hard to make them and when I did I would often get hurt so now there’s just a wall. And I’ve just really struggled with myself. All the usual low self esteem, anxiety, paranoia, depression. I’m keeping it brief since I feel like I can write a book.

I’m a really lonely person and have been for a long time and I know it’s because I’ve just never had a proper normal relationship with anyone. My family don’t talk about emotions and all that and with all the trauma I’ve always been very closed off with them ready to bolt as soon as I can. And since I’ve always struggled with friends I’ve just never had anyone around (I have friends now but we’re just not good friends I’m unsure how to explain it). I’ve also never had a boyfriend so it’s always felt like just me. I’m very used to people abandoning me so I’m closed off. 

My depression has also just killed the things I love as it often does and I really struggled to enjoy anything or find motivation for it. I went to uni this year and dropped out after a month and still haven’t got a job. I’ve been applying but haven’t made any cuts and for the one I made the cut for I couldn’t do cause my anxiety was so bad. I feel awful not being able to get a job and getting my shit together but nothing makes me feel motivated or happy. 

I really just want to be able to feel nothing, more out of convenience for my own and everyone else’s sake. I do really want to kill myself but I would never do it cause I know that it can fuck up those around you and I know what a persons death can do to people. I feel more like I’m just waiting for everyone to leave just so I can die without fucking anyone up. I know I’m quite smart ( the only good thing I would say about myself) and I kno there are people with lot bigger problems who still keep going but that thought only makes be feel more guilty but I also know everyone’s pain is still significant, I just go in a constant circle. 

My only safe space has been my bedroom cause it’s been the only place I could cry and breathe without being in edge around people. 

I’ve done self harm, I’ve done therapy, I’ve tried getting better by myself but I feel like I’m stuck in the same place constantly. I’m going on meds tomorrow but rather than making me feel better I’m hoping they’ll just make me feel nothing.","I’m just tired and want to feel nothingI’ve never done a reddit post or anything before but essentially I’ve been depressed for over 10+ years (20 now) and I’m just really tired. 

For a brief summary I’ve always struggled with family (dad I don’t get along with is an arse, mom who is mentally unstable herself but is in denial and is far to kind to the point that it hurts everyone (the type to constantly be ripped off but to do the exact same thing again and again), ex-step dad who made false promises and has gone off the edge of the earth, ex-step mom whose a 14yr bitchy girl stuck inside a women’s body, older sister who is very over opinionated and it’s her way or the high way and a little sister who is young enough that she’s missed most the trauma but I don’t get to see often because she lives with my dad) I don’t want to get into it because it’s a long story that has lasted all my life. I’ve always really struggled with friends. I find it really hard to make them and when I did I would often get hurt so now there’s just a wall. And I’ve just really struggled with myself. All the usual low self esteem, anxiety, paranoia, depression. I’m keeping it brief since I feel like I can write a book.

I’m a really lonely person and have been for a long time and I know it’s because I’ve just never had a proper normal relationship with anyone. My family don’t talk about emotions and all that and with all the trauma I’ve always been very closed off with them ready to bolt as soon as I can. And since I’ve always struggled with friends I’ve just never had anyone around (I have friends now but we’re just not good friends I’m unsure how to explain it). I’ve also never had a boyfriend so it’s always felt like just me. I’m very used to people abandoning me so I’m closed off. 

My depression has also just killed the things I love as it often does and I really struggled to enjoy anything or find motivation for it. I went to uni this year and dropped out after a month and still haven’t got a job. I’ve been applying but haven’t made any cuts and for the one I made the cut for I couldn’t do cause my anxiety was so bad. I feel awful not being able to get a job and getting my shit together but nothing makes me feel motivated or happy. 

I really just want to be able to feel nothing, more out of convenience for my own and everyone else’s sake. I do really want to kill myself but I would never do it cause I know that it can fuck up those around you and I know what a persons death can do to people.

1719,How do I get myself out of a rut/slump? How do I stop self-punishing myself?,"It seems I have been in a rut/slump for five years and I don't know how to get myself out of it.  I seem to be subconciously self-punishing myself for everything that I view as a flaw.  I don't know what hobbies I could do,  It really frustrates me that I don't know what makes me happy anymore. 

I feel that my sister doesn't truly support me in my  gender transistioning even though she keeps saying she does.  It seems like her and I just have different love languages (Hers is gift giving and mines is words of affirmation) , and so it makes me feel like her vibe is inconsistent and that frustrates me even more. 

I have been constantly feeling terrible about myself and others, but I primarily take it out on myself because I don't want to hurt other people with my emotions.   

I am very tired of feeling like I don't like myself and I want to care about myself...but I don't really know how.  

My parents basically told me that I evolved backwords, I was a very happy kid that could do quite a lot when I was a child,  but now as an adult I hesitate,  I close down,  I feel like  a shell of my former self.  

I don't know what caused me to change to a completely different person, and I'd like to at least be a little more confident in my abilities.","How do I get myself out of a rut/slump?

1956,Being a teenager sucks,"Hi,
To preface this I'm going to sum up myself. I'm a lonely geek teenager that's an only child with no pets, like stereotype computer geek. 
I just got back into physical classes again after 2 years doing online ones which I preferred I just moved and am having a tough time making friends and a tough time with my parents We're in a small apartment while ours gets renovated so I'm sleeping on the couch and then going to school with no privacy really. My parents always try to turn the tables on me and then make things my fault or make me do things then insult me for things I'm forced to do. I got some clothes a while ago I said I didn't like and I said I didn't like the fit , so I didn't wear them, now its my fault that I ""asked for them"" (or other times they just say that I have to wear stuff because they say so). It feels like every night there's a screaming match between me and my dad or my parents , my mother is always seemingly depressed or has an attitude , I don't have friends and don't know how to make any. I just really don't know what to do. Teenagers nowadays don't care about Linux or old music , all they wanna listen to is shitty rap and use fucking tiktok. 
When we went to my doctor I had to take an exam where I have ""high signs of depression"" and my parents were told I should see a psychologist , that never happened of course They have alcohol with breakfast, lunch, and dinner which doesn't help either and it always feels like the standards are against me and that everything I do gets judged. They treat me like they own me and like I can't speak. Because no matter what I think my mom is always more important (all she does it cook and smash I swear to god) I really don't know what to do.  I've tried offing myself in the past and my mom laughed at me and screamed ""don't be ridiculous"". I tried to come out as LGBT+ to them and was made fun of and still am and I have to lie that I'm not. It makes me so angry seeing other people in classes and knowing they have pets and siblings and loving parents , and I don't. 
""We just want the best for you""
Telling me to off myself and that everything I do isn't goof enough doesn't fucking solve that. 

As I said , idk what to do","Being a teenager sucksHi,

I've said this to my psychiatrist, and ive tried to make appointments time and time again. She just doesn't get back to me. When I do have an appointment she's about 30 minutes late for a 30 minute appointment. I'm just feeling incredibly frustrated with this. I get that she's busy and that life happens but its impossible to reach her. 

Im going to a new psychiatrist at the end of the month. Should I share these experiences? Should I share that I think my dosage is a bit high for not working well? I'm nervous about this. I just don't want to feel dismissed again. 

I feel a little defeated. Like I do a lot to manage my mental well-being but its like the therapies and meds just never help. I don't know how many more times I need to tell someone I'm sad in a therapy session.

541,My dog is going to die soon (I think) and my family jokes about it.,I’ve had my dog Kai since I was 9 so he’s 11 now I think. He’s basically been my emotional support animal for the past 11 years and I’ve come to rely on him through much of my struggles. My family loves him but doesn’t really like him much. He just smells bad and no one really knows why. So they always joke about him dying even though they know it hurts me. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t know what I’ll do when he dies. I have a therapist but I don’t really have anyone else I confide in about these things besides my wife but she makes jokes too. The last time I had a dog die it almost killed me. We had her while we had Kai. I’ve just not prepared myself for when Kai dies and I’m scared it might shatter me too much. If you guys have any advice on somethings I can do to prepare and to handle this situation that would be amazing.

1885,Making the same mistake years later.,"Hello, sorry for a long post. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. Thank you for whoever reads this.

I'll start with events 4 years ago when it all started.  I am 22 year old male. I used to work in a bar where I met a girl I instantly fell in love with . We got to know each other well, went on dates etc. She was everything I ever wished for.

I'm from a small village and I have some good friends here. We  were always considered to be the  ""bad guys"" because we partied a lot etc. I never done drugs thought.

She always assumed I do drugs and one day I decided to take some to impress her ( stupid I know) I guess to keep up with the bad guy reputation. Problem is, I fell in love with cocaine.

And that's when my life went into a downwards spiral. I started taking cocaine for breakfast everyday. I turned it an angry mess, our relationship slowly got ruined. I was angry at her one day and tried sleeping with her best friend. I was nothing but a scumbag. I was a cheating,  lying scumbag. I didn't see that at the time but now it's very clear for me to see. She deserved better than me

After overdosing once, We broke up and she moved away. I decided I had enough and went sober.  I went through some very rough time then. I was very deeply hurt and depressed. Day by day it got better. 

4 years have passed and I still never fully got over her even when I was with other girls but I was living more or less fine. I don't really like this town but I have some great friends and reasonably good new job.

Anyway, after all these years, last weekend I was out drinking with friends and I met an old friend who offered me a bag of cocaine for some reason i  snapped back to my old habits and bought a bag.

I knew she was back in town, later on I ended up at a house party where I got in to a very bad state with drugs and alcohol. And out of all the placed I could of met her again she walked in to the kitchen where I was dashing out lines of cocaine in a state where I could barely stand or speak. I tried telling her I wasn't the man I was when we first met,  but of course she didn't believe it, why would she ?  Somehow I managed to achieve some sort of success with her. We danced and kissed etc. But she's probably just lonely since coming back to town since most of her friends are gone away. We never had sex that night but I couldn't have sex even if I wanted to due to state I was in.

I woke up next morning and all my feeling for her came back, all the love it took me years to forget, but I knew that it was over, it was just a one night thing. It crushed me. All these years breaking away from my habits wasted when it came down to a person it mattered. I was still the same lying drug addict in her eyes as I was 4 years ago.

It's been a week and I feel empty, only emotion I have is constant hint of anger and sadness in me. I stopped eating or doing anything except working , I work 9-5 and then I go to my garage where I work on projects and drink alcohol until am I able to sleep. Maybe I am still the same scumbag I was 4 years ago. Iv been having suicidal thoughts but I know I can't do that since I need to look after my family. I would rather suffer myself then let my family suffer. 

At first I thought it was just a comedown from drugs since I haven't touched them in so long. But I still miss her more and more everyday. I have dreams about her at night where we are happy together. I messaged her a few times but she's always busy and takes a long time to reply.

I'm just so lost, all these years to recover just to slip back into my old days when it mattered the most. She gave me an opportunity to fix what I once broke but instead I proceeded to ruin it further. 

Thank you to whoever reads this. I just wanted to get this of my chest or speak to someone anonymously.","Making the same mistake years later.Hello, sorry for a long post. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. Thank you for whoever reads this.

I'll start with events 4 years ago when it all started.  I am 22 year old male. I used to work in a bar where I met a girl I instantly fell in love with . We got to know each other well, went on dates etc. She was everything I ever wished for.

I'm from a small village and I have some good friends here. We  were always considered to be the  ""bad guys"" because we partied a lot etc. I never done drugs thought.

I've been like this always I never finished something I  started, I'm also broke and living alone...

I don't work hard for my future I hate myself so much that I keep torturing myself...

I'm struggling with depression and anxiety disorder, and no-one cares even my parents they don't understand, I keep my suffering to myself... and I can't go to the therapist cause I'm broke, what I make is enough to just keep me alive

827,FIRE!!!," I can't take anymore stress. Anymore loss. I've had enough. I've fallen so deep into a depression that I've completely let myself go. And I mean completely. I barely have the energy or drive to crawl out of bed. There is no function in my life anymore, I'm simply existing.

I am pretty much alone now. I've lost everything. I have had nonstop loss and stress since June of 2018 and it's not letting up. I'm at the point now to where if I'm lucky enough to sleep, I'll wake, up wondering who in my life is going to die that day or what terrible thing is going to happen.
at's what it feels like. Like I'm outside of myself watching
The last straw was the breakup of my 9 year live in relationship. He came home from work and dumped me out of the blue. He moved out 3 days later, leaving me with our large rental house, it's utilities and other bills. We split everything and I've had to take over his share. My elderly mom lives here with me and her income helps but she is ill and is now developing either Dementia or early Alzheimers.

I loved my ex so much and his loss alone has nearly put me under. It's been 9 mos since he walked and I found out he had been cheating online. Well that's over and now he has a new girlfriend, my worst nightmare was the day I was going to have to see that. She has money and I really think that's the only reason why he's with her, which is sad. We have stayed in touch mostly by text and he sees our animals we owned together. Now that he has her he no longer wants to see all of our animals and doesn't want to talk to me. He told me it hurts him to talk to me. Yeah right!!! I may be severely depressed but I'm not stupid.

Add the Covid stress to everything I've had to deal with and I feel like I'm losing it. I've never gone this long without a shower. I've never gone days at a time without sleep. Sometimes I'll go 4 days without eating.

God help me.","FIRE!!! I can't take anymore stress. Anymore loss. I've had enough. I've fallen so deep into a depression that I've completely let myself go. And I mean completely. I barely have the energy or drive to crawl out of bed. There is no function in my life anymore, I'm simply existing.

751,Afternoon Anxiety and Depression,"For the past couple of months I have had really bad anxiety and depression at night. I have been dealing with both for years now, almost I think since middle school, I'm 27 now. However, since August of last year, when I had my first and only anxiety attack, I was out with my friends and my anxiety got so bad that I had force them to call me an uber so I could just go home and sleep it off. I told myself and my parents that if I didn't feel better in the morning, I was going to the hospital. I never felt that bad in my life and I have been worried about it happening again. There are a lot of stressful things going on in my life right now, somethings that I think maybe life changing, but I cant be sure until the time comes and it might be sooner then later. I can elaborate if you guys want, but its a long story. I feel fine in the morning, I feel great in the morning. I'm very positive and eager to get things done. It hits me around  3 or 4 pm. Something will trigger it that will cause me to think negative thoughts and it will affect me the rest of the night, but if I had that same thought at like 9 am, I would shrug it off and think, something like ""It not happening now, so don't worry about it"". It has ruined a lot of things for me. Going out with friends is now dreadful. I used to look forward to hanging out with people, but now I would rather stay at home. My sleep schedule is going to bed as early as possible because I cant stand the anxiety. It even stops me from doing chores, I drop everything and want to sleep. It seems like ever since I had the anxiety attack, this has been happening every night. Am I subconsciously worrying about having another panic attack? What can I do to help ease my thoughts. I would love to go out with my friends again without feeling this way. I am seeing a Psychologist and taking meds at the moment. Insurance sucks, so a therapist would cost me $70+ and I don't have the money for it and money is probably my biggest anxiety factor.","Afternoon Anxiety and DepressionFor the past couple of months I have had really bad anxiety and depression at night.

1337,"Almost 20 years of social anxiety, how do I go on?","So I'm trying to get over social anxiety for almost 20 years now, 18 of them spent running around from one therapist to another and nothing helped. I'm going to another psychiatrist in a few days, and while I was the one to set the appointment I still feel there's no point. I tried CBT, pills, and was once arrested and voluntarily hospitalized for making a dangerous post. Is there anything specific I should say to the therapist? At this point they just send me to a different psychologist every time but I somehow manage to be too hard for them to get through to. I.E. one psychologist, every meeting, asked ""what are you thinking about"" as I was staring at the carpet waiting for them to speak, my answer was always simply: ""nothing"", as it really was nothing, I just shut off thought if there's no conversation, and it went like this until I got hospitalized where the psychologists in the hospital told me to stop making appointments with her. At any rate, 18 years of therapy, my social anxiety can probably be compared to selective mutism with how severe it is, what do I do?

Overall, I quit my job with no desire to find a new one, lost interest in most of my hobbies, lost interest in improving myself because it didn't make me feel better at the end (lost weight, listened to 40 books, tried out MMA, tried singing lessons, went to the gym, worked at a hotel to try and get my social anxiety solved, reconnected with old friends and then lost the connection with them after burning out.

I know of 0 people that went to therapy and claimed it helped them. Every single one that I asked said it's just a scam and at this point I can only agree, the success rate is just too low to justify wasting time on it, especially since I already wasted 18 years.","Almost 20 years of social anxiety, how do I go on?So I'm trying to get over social anxiety for almost 20 years now, 18 of them spent running around from one therapist to another and nothing helped.

240,I'm a Neuroscientist - Need your help with a science video on Depression,"I'm a Neuroscientist (PhD-Candidate in the Netherlands, originally from Austria) and on the side, I make science videos about the brain, human behavior, and biology (if you're curious: [https://www.youtube.com/c/Brainstorm2018](https://www.youtube.com/c/Brainstorm2018)).

Currently, I'm working on my next video which will be about Depression and I could use the help of this Community/subreddit. My background allows me to understand the science and psychology of depression but, luckily, I never have suffered from it myself (though I experienced it second-hand when my mum got a major depressive episode a few years back). So I want to add to the video by infusing it with personal stories and experiences of real people who have suffered or are suffering from depression.

**I have 2 questions**

1. What would be the single most important thing the 'public' gets wrong about Depression. What do people who never had any experience with it don't get?
2. If anyone wants to share a story or personal experience with depression that I could incorporate in the next video (anonymously without username if desired) I would be honored.

This is an amazing subreddit and I appreciate all your comments and feedback. Please feel free to ask me any questions.

All the best to all of you!

184,"Feeling helpless, stuck, and confused","I don't understand why I'm so depressed all the time, like I just can't cope with what I have to deal with. I'm on multiple medications and I'm trying so hard to get a therapist but where I live you need parental consent, and I'm not in public school because of my disorders so I can't get a school counsellor, and I'm so scared of counselling now because one wrong word, one accidental confession and they'll lock me up in a psych ward again and that was the hardest, most embarrassing, and most traumatic experience I've ever had, that I now have diagnosed PTSD from it. I just don't understand why I'm like this, like I want to be normal and happy and go to school and go out with friends and get a job and a boyfriend and be productive and enjoy life and I try so so so so hard but it's never enough, I never feel any better. I feel like I'm gonna be like this forever. I just want a normal brain, without any mental illnesses and trauma. This is so debilitating I can't even function on a normal level. I'm five steps behind everyone around me. They're graduating and I can't get out of bed to do my schoolwork I get from an alternative school, because eventually I have to hand it in and then take a test in an area of complete strangers for the entire day, doing nothing after the test, and sitting there for the rest of the day because no one can pick me up and I have no way to get home until my mom gets off work, 3 hours after the school is closed. The amount of anxiety that situation gives me makes me sick. I *want* to do it, I want to get my schooling done and graduate but it takes so much to bring me to even have a sliver of confidence to even consider going. Not to mention, my family makes fun of me for it and always makes jokes about ""Well, that's because your sister actually graduated"" ""Not until you graduate"" ""Well it gives *me* anxiety when you don't do your schoolwork"" (Being said by someone who has never experienced even the slightest bit of an anxiety disorder). I've tried to explain why doing basic tasks is so hard for me but it's hard to explain something to someone who will never get it and just label you as lazy. And whenever I try to explain how I feel, I'm ""having a meltdown"" and ""being selfish"" and ""you just need your meds right now"". It just feels as if my feelings and professionally diagnosed mental illnesses are being brushed off and not taken seriously. I've had multiple attempts and for a week or so after an attempt, everyone suddenly cares and supports me but then it quickly wears off, and ""If it was really that bad you would've actually killed yourself"", or ""You need to start making a *real* effort this time"". I have no support systems or people I can talk to and the only reason I haven't succeeded is because I can't leave my dog. I've had her since the day she was born and people call her the dog version of me. We're so insanely close people are shocked by how mentally connected we are, and she gets upset when I'm not with her. We're two halves of a whole and she's saved my life multiple times so i can't just abandon her like that, I love her with all my heart. So I guess what I'm saying is I feel insanely stuck in my situation right now. I'm a minor, no job, no license to be able to transport myself to get a job, no support system, no one to talk to who completely understands, no therapy access. I just feel like a hopeless cause because what could someone even do in this situation? My mom constantly gets mad at me for having anxiety attacks and I feel like I'm just a burden to her, because she's the one who has to pick up my medications, etc. and she is always yelling at me because she has to take the responsibility of having a kid with a mental illness, and she won't do any research on my illnesses or how to manage a kid dealing with them even though I've asked her many many times to. I just feel completely alone and helpless, and no where to go, and I'm always terrified of asking for help or support because I don't want to be a burden to them as well or seem selfish or I'm asking for pity. No one around me seems to actively care and help me live with my illnesses, because I really need some help dealing with this, I can't get through this on my own.","Feeling helpless, stuck, and confusedI don't understand why I'm so depressed all the time, like I just can't cope with what I have to deal with.

How do I exists in a life i don't want with nothing left to live for?

156,"I hate who i am, i don't know how to change.","I've been a neet for 2 and a half years, mostly because i'm somewhat socially retarded, not only am i not good at making small talk or generally talking to people in real life, but i also have no interest in doing so with most of the people that are around me for whatever reason, i also use the fact that i have a heart condition that doesn't allow me to make a lot of physical effort to justify the fact that i'm a neet but the truth is that i'm mostly afraid of having to deal with people.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first 18 years of my life my heart condition wasn't that bad (or maybe it was and i was just used to it) i noticed something was wrong when i started working out and my left arm started hurting one thing led to another and now i can't drink coffee or alcohol or work out anymore, the not being able to work out part made me really depressed since working out usually just made any negative feelings i had go away for some reason, and i was determined to lose weight at the time, now i'm overweight have skinny arms and i don't look anything like i wish i would.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also not interested in pursuing higher education, i barely passed through high school and i know i'm just not cut out for it even though my iq is 2 whole points above the standard!

&amp;#x200B;

My parents feed my bad habits probably because they feel some guilt for turning out the way i am they used to scold me for being shy and not doing well in school but they also shit talked me for a lot of small things that i don't really want to remember eventually i started confronting them about it and now they don't really know how to handle me so they just kind leave me to do whatever i want, their generation was very different from mine and i don't blame them for not knowing how to deal with the modern problems i have, i kind of wish they'd threaten to kick me out or something

&amp;#x200B;

Now i mostly spend my time consuming media but recently i've been feeling really bad about wasting my time, if any of you have any advice or can point me to a book on self help or anything like that i'd appreciate it, also i don't have the money to afford any good therapy.","I hate who i am, i don't know how to change.I've been a neet for 2 and a half years, mostly because i'm somewhat socially retarded, not only am i not good at making small talk or generally talking to people in real life, but i also have no interest in doing so with most of the people that are around me for whatever reason, i also use the fact that i have a heart condition that doesn't allow me to make a lot of physical effort to justify the fact that i'm a neet but the truth is that i'm mostly afraid of having to deal with people.

1266,Soon to be dad and I’m struggling to cope,So I’ve written posts about this before but here’s the basics. My pregnant girlfriend split up with me. She said she dident love me anymore. I lost my temper and said some things I shouldn’t have which I admit was my fault. We dident talk or have any contact for 6 weeks I drunk heavily during this time and my depression was unbearable. I eventually reached out and apologised and explained I wanted to be there for the baby. She agrees I meet her for the first time since we broke up and she makes it clear she never wants to get back together and just wants to be friends. So since then I’ve cut right back on my drinking intact I don’t drink anymore. As the son of a alcoholic looser father I don’t want that for my child I want to be a good dad. Anyway every time I talk to her it feels like a kick in the teeth. So I actively avoid messaging her and only respond to her when she messages me cause of all the pain it brings up. The only thing keeping me going is the baby. But it’s been 10 weeks since we broke up and I still feel just as broken and miserable inside. I don’t have any friends I sit on my PlayStation all day just trying to zone out and focus on something other than how miserable I am. I thought that when I stopped drinking I would feel better and to be honest I don’t I still feel like shit. I have a therapist who’s helpful and a support worker to help me not go back to drinking.

1625,Should I feel like a loser,"Basically the title. I’m 21F, and going to post my life story I guess. Thank you for any advice, or just being honest. I feel like a failure.

I’ve never had a job. Even in high school I just wanted to focus on doing good in school, not splitting my time for some minimum wage fast food job, but I guess everyone else in the world already had a job in high school. I still don’t have a job, have never tried to apply/get an interview, and now I feel like I don’t even have time for one. I’m going to be in college full time again next month, I don’t drive anymore, I just don’t see the point. Should I be even more miserable and have less time for school just so I can finally “check the box” of having a job?

I don’t drive anymore. I did it everyday for 2 years with no real problems but then the stress wasn’t worth it anymore. I hate the gravel roads/potholes of this town, hate driving on ice for 10 months of the year, I just don’t ever want to deal with the stress again. I’ve lived with my parents ever since the pandemic, and of course not being able to drive makes me feel like I don’t have any agency or independence. Can’t go to school or a job because I feel like a huge burden and failure whenever I ask them to take me anywhere.

I don’t have any friends and don’t really feel worthy enough to have any, but I’ve accepted that for a while. I feel so ugly and worthless and I think any reasonable person would probably agree. I have nothing to offer.

I guess I’m going to email a therapist again soon, even though I have no health insurance and certainly don’t have the money to just spend. I was trying to save my student loan money but I don’t even know what the point is anymore.

Thanks for reading. Just really not enjoying anything lately, and I can’t really get “out into the world” at all because there’s no in-person classes, nothing to do, and I feel like a burden every time I ask for something from my parents when they’re working.","Should I feel like a loserBasically the title.

236,I took my best friend to Florida for a getaway in the hopes that it would help my depression. Worst. Mistake. Ever.,"Hi, first time posting here and I'm kinda a wreck right now so sorry if the formatting is a bit off.

So, I've been struggling with very severe depression, and even suicidal thoughts. I've been in touch with a mentor, and I suggested going to FL (I live in Virginia, and I have family in Florida) and she thought that would be a good idea, you know, get away from everything for a few days. So, I booked the trip and invited my best friend (who will remain nameless) to go with me. He quickly agreed (especially since he's been on suicide watch for me for over 3 months) and we got out tickets and all was dandy. 

Today, day 2 of said trip, I've completely lost my friend to the Fortnite video game. I've tried to do stuff with him, he politely declines. I've tried to talk to him, but as soon as I get sick (unfortunately, my main stress coping mechanism is vomiting, completely involuntary. I don't force it) he goes ba k to the game and when I need him the most when I've hit my lowest point (moments ago) he leaves. LEAVES!!

I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do. I feel completely alone. Even my family (all except my dad) have used me out completely and taken to my friend instead. 

I don't know what to do, I've never felt so alone while I'm surrounded by 8 of my closest family members and my best friend. 

Please help me. I don't know how else to end this. Please help me.","I took my best friend to Florida for a getaway in the hopes that it would help my depression. Worst. Mistake. Ever.Hi, first time posting here and I'm kinda a wreck right now so sorry if the formatting is a bit off.

Today my wife spent 22+ hours asleep or just in bed. This is a new record. 

Her speech has slowed noticeably. 

I ask her what she's thinking and she responds, ""nothing."" or ""I don't know."" This in particular is frightening to me. I try to clarify. ""Is it hard to put into words? Do you not feel comfortable or safe telling me for some reason?"" She says that's not it. She just doesn't have any thoughts. This seems totally impossible to me. But I'm trusting that she's being honest. Is, for lack of a better word, literal ""thoughtlessness"" a symptom of depression that is documented somewhere I have yet to find?

Just looking to cast a wide net for experience here. Trying everything I can.

Leaving her alone doesn't work. Helping doesn't work.

983,is this a normal for parents to do?,"When i was like 11/12 years old someone had done a poo in the toilet and left it and my Mum found it and both my brother and I said that we didn’t do it. 
So my Mum made us both bend over in front of Dad and her and wiped our bums for us and then showed everyone the piece of toilet paper and whether it had shit on it or not.

I remember her telling us to bend over more because she said she couldn’t reach. 

My subconscious and conscious is telling me i’m a horrible person for saying this about my parents and that i’m just imagining it. But i know i’m not. It’s killing me not being able to remember things from this event and from when my Mum left.

The next parts foggy but i know that the first part above is definitely accurate 

I think my Mum wiped my bum and got shit on the paper and blamed it on me or something idk. And then i think my brother had shit on his paper as well. I think we were both ridiculed. 

I have many traumas involving my parents since then. I’m now 18. And i’ve been in an emotionally incestuous relationship with my Father. 
My brother beats me. And my Mum doesn’t do anything because she feels powerless because she’s now a single mother (my parents are separated) 

I also reported my brother to the police last year for touching my boobs and beating me with a belt (which my mum saw). But nothing happened and i don’t think the police believed me because i was overweight. 

Anyway, what’s everyone opinion on the poo wiping situation. Is that normal for parents to do?","is this a normal for parents to do?When i was like 11/12 years old someone had done a poo in the toilet and left it and my Mum found it and both my brother and I said that we didn’t do it.

374,What can I do to stop being a weirdo?,"A lot of people have called me a weirdo and I know why. 
I laugh really loudly (it's super obnoxious and I think I do it because I'm an attention seeker and it make it seem like what my friend and I are talking about a lot funnier that it actually is because I want people to think I'm funny). I also laugh at jokes even if they're not funny (because it's less awkward than sitting there in silence and not knowing what to say)
I constantly do weird shit like talk really loudly or in different accents (again, it might be because I want people to think I'm funny)
I don't think before I speak. I start a sentence and then I stop because then I realise I shouldn't say something. It's like my brain's delayed. I begin to say something and then I tell them to ignore me (I think my brain's on autopilot all the time and I don't think)
I constantly stare at people and make eye contact with them (which is just weird, it's also creepy) 
Sometimes when I speak super fast, I end up speaking gibberish and no one knows what I'm saying (again, it might be because I don't think before I speak)
I make weird, sharp movements (because I'm thinking out loud and I forget that I'm not alone)
I make weird sounds in general (I don't know if it's because I'm so bored and I need to keep myself busy or if I'm a psychopath)
I fidget a lot and I can't keep my hands to myself 
I don't know if it's because I feel so out of place or if it's because I feel so uncomfortable all the time and that's why I do all of these things. I just feel so strange and I agree with people when they call me a weirdo (even though I hate to admit it)
I feel so on edge all the time and I don't know how to calm myself down. I'm so hyper all the time. But at the same time if I stay calm, I feel like I'm boring the person and then I panic and then I start acting like a weirdo (it's a never ending cycle)
I'm constantly daydreaming because I hate my current situation and weirdly enough when I imagine talking to someone my lips move and it seems like I'm talking to myself (which is super embarrassing). Daydreaming takes my mind off of everything, but it's super depressing when I stop and I come back to reality (I'm a lot better now and I don't daydream as much)
I constantly feel like I'm under so much pressure 
I'm not feminine in any way. I don't care of my appearance and I smell (but I just don't feel like taking care of myself, I know it's a crappy excuse). I feel so masculine and I hate it. I love being a girl, but I don't know why I can't bring myself to act like one. I sit like a man too. 
As weird as it sounds, I feel like I'm watching myself play a character. Almost as if I'm not allowing myself to be my true self because I think I'm boring. I don't know why I can't allow myself to slow down. 
I'm always rushing myself and I have to do everything at an unusually fast pace. I'm so erratic with everything, whether it be me talking to someone or walking. I don't know what to do about this. 
I don't know if it's because my family have always called me insane and as an act of rebellion, maybe I'm acting like that because I believe it too. 
I don't think I'm insane but, maybe I'm wrong?
It's driving people away and it's driving me insane.

1794,Time for meds?,"Hi. Question if anyone could help me. I’m considering finding a dr and asking for this drug. BUT. I always thought that anti-depressants or for people that were depressed for no real reason. It was simply a chemical in balance and no matter what was going on in their life good or bad they were depressed. That’s not me. But in the last 18 months, my mom has been diagnosed with dementia and majorly spiraled and there’s a lot of insane sadness and anger and abuse that comes with that, my stepmom was diagnosed with colon cancer has had two major surgeries and is on her second round of chemo, my dad is of course a nervous wreck and he’s already a hypochondriac overweight. The pandemic closed down my entire industry and career and I had to move cities back home to help my sick family so I have no friends here and no employment in the career that I’ve been extremely successful in for the last 30 years. I finally found a boyfriend that I really loved and thought everything was going well, but we had two miscarriages and it went downhill really fast and we wound up breaking up a few days ago. My 16 year old furbaby is dying and the boyfriend took “our” dog. I also lost a couple of jobs that I really wanted and I really could go on and on about the nonstop bad things that of happened. I am able to get up in the morning and function and go to my few little jobs and hang out with my family and take care of them. But I am extraordinarily sad I cry multiple times a day. I had my 40th birthday this year and I’m terrified I’ll be alone and childless forever. I had a prescription for Valium and I have some left so I have been taking one of those in the morning and it may be helps a tiny bit. Anyway I guess I’m wondering if I take an SSRI if it will make any difference if I don’t really have a chemical in balance I’m just currently having a really shitty life and none of those things are gonna change anytime soon. I did start talking to a therapist on an app but I’m not sure I like it and may have to find one in person soon. Anyway. Should I take an SSRI? I’m scared of side effects. I’m scared of fertility issues. I’m scared of weight gain. I’m scared it won’t work since I have REASONS to be depressed. Any advice would be so appreciated.","Time for meds?Hi.

I did start talking to a therapist on an app but I’m not sure I like it and may have to find one in person soon. Anyway. Should I take an SSRI? I’m scared of side effects. I’m scared of fertility issues. I’m scared of weight gain. I’m scared it won’t work since I have REASONS to be depressed.

903,What can I do to have a normal life?,"My neglectful narcissistic dad has ruined my life.

Right now my confidence is lower than ever. I'm too self conscious to even go out to the kitchen. I'm extremely embarrassed of my body if my blanket is not covering it. I haven't talked to anyone besides my parents in over a year (except for the time when I had to go to my high school for exams 6 months ago. I dropped out shortly after). 

I suppress my emotions as much as I can, even when no one is around. When we're visiting relatives I pretend to be the perfect little girl, who smiles all the time and loves to study, has big plans for the future, etc.

I'm worried that if things don't change, I'll just end it all (I'm not suicidal, so maybe in 5-6 years?). As of now, I'm not a functional human being and I have no use for anyone. I spend the whole day scrolling through reddit, watching videos on youtube and playing minecraft.

I want to get a job to get out of here asap, but I can't even look into someone else's eyes without getting a panic attack. I can't keep a conversation going even through texting. 

Therapy is not an option. The last 3 therapists have ruined my confidence and self esteem even more.

I want friends, I want someone to talk to me, I want someone to care about me and I want someone to care about, I want a boyfriend, I want to worry about things people my age worry about, I want to finally live the life I want to. I'm sick of this constant despair, I want to stop hating on everyone who has it better. I want to be normal.


How do I get started? What do I do? Do I even have a chance for life?","What can I do to have a normal life?My neglectful narcissistic dad has ruined my life.

No comforting words can console me. Every time I take a nap I really I would die. I am even having this evil thought I get corona virus or something.

My sister shouted fake news when she thought I passed. I saw their excitement. My parents ran towards me. But when I said I actually failed again they just turned their back and left. No comfort whatsoever. So now I am all alone. Images of my ex when we were breaking up during my bar review was recurring and his words which go like I have nothing to be proud of. I just proved him right. My friends are all cheering up on me but everything is just cliche. And what do I expect? They cannot mourn with me bec they are all celebrating. 

I am currently employed in a law firm that I love but if I have to take the bar again, I need to resign to pave way for my review. I also don't want to stay because the work would get me reminded that I am not a lawyer. It is heartbreaking to leave a firm I finally love. Then bar in our country is moved to 2021 due to corona virus. I am going to derail my life for 2 years. I am more than delayed. I feel so left out. I see no purpose in life. I am starting to give up on my dream of being an attorney. I want my life to end. I think I've seen enough.This life keeps on knocking me down as I am that strong.

1,I don’t have anyone to talk to and I don’t know what to do anymore,"Nine years ago I was diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety disorder, Six years later I was also diagnosed with PTSD due to sexual assault trauma, and finally stopped living in denial and got a formal diagnosis plus started treatment for anorexia nervosa. my life’s kinda been a train wreck for the most part. I always remember being deeply sad with an overly critical and hateful view of the world around me (human kind are doing nothing productive for the earth and it would be best if we walked hand in hand to extinction to save the planet kind of hateful) or for some periods of time feeling like I’m buzzing with happiness, in which times I felt unstoppable. With my first diagnosis, my first set of meds followed, I trialled quite a few over the years but when I decided they didn’t work for me I tried self medicating with anything I could get my hands on and ended up with major substance abuse issues. I’ve now just managed to get myself sober and maintain it for the last month.
I feel as if I’m being sucked into a giant pit of despair I can’t get myself out of and It’s progressively getting harder to leave bed. 
I get panic attacks before and during leaving the house because I’m terrified someone’s going to hurt me. I only go out to get groceries and even then sometimes I get there, panic and can’t leave the car so I just go home. 
I can’t sleep properly anymore due to horrible nightmares. I can never shake the feeling that I’m a giant burden to everyone in my life so I can’t talk to them about when I’m struggling. I’ve isolated myself so much over the past few years I don’t have a single friend left. 
I’d like to try medication again but I’m too terrified to try anything and have panic attacks thinking about taking something to shut up my mind in fear of getting addicted and out of control. Has anyone else struggled with this? What helped you overcome it?

69,Talk about depression in job interview?,"Hey guys,

I've been subject to a lot of depression episodes recently, which really sucks because I'm currently actively looking for a job. I started kind of taking care of my depression a few months ago, but I still experience really bad days (suicidal thoughts and such).

The things is, before fully dedicating myself to finding a job, I decided to take a few months off. This means I would allow myself to put my job research on hold while *really* taking measures to work on my depression for the first time in my life. 

The problem I'm facing now during job interviews is the dreaded question ""But what have you been doing for the past 5 months? I see no job experience, no nothing."" with the nice tone of voice ""Have you been doing fuck all? ♥""

I was thus wondering, what would a good answer be to that sort of question?

Cus I'm not sure giving the depression background during an interview would really help my case, and on another end,  I've not been doing ""fuck all"", just not what they want to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really lost on this point, cus I really want to start working again. I feel like it would be the next step toward winning over this freaking depression.

I don't want to lie during a job interview, because I feel it would give a bad start to a possible work partnership, but on another hand, should I?

&amp;#x200B;

Did you guys ever had to face that situation before?

Any beginning of answer would really help!

1416,Is this depression or something else?,"I noticed my bf had been acting off (kind of aloof and withdrawn) lately but every time I asked he said he was ok and just tired. Last night I asked again and he said he's ok but when he got home he told me that he doesn't feel right mentally like if something is off. He just wants to lock himself in his room all the time and he said it's been a few months like this but that he is just now noticing it. He said he has low sexual attraction and Isn't in the mood much and is disgusted with the thought of sex but still loves me but it's just more pure? 

Now he's had little bouts like this before and so I asked if it's like the other times and he said no that he feels just blank. It sounds a lot like depression but I am not sure. I've told him that he should go to the doctor/physiologist to get this checked in the past (I almost got him to go in the past but the office in his network in my town did not have any appointments until several months down the road which is crazy IMO) but he can be very stubborn on this. He usually gets out of them eventually but I get really worried and concerned for him and I don't want him to suffer with this. I wish I could just make it go away. 

I'm here because I need help in determining if this is depression or something else and asking for your advice on things we can do to get him help ( I'm going to try again for the doctor / phycologist but I know it's going to be difficult to get him to do this) practically and things he can start doing that can help him get out of this. 

Today I'm planning to get him out of the house and walk a nature trail (we like photography and stuff) and take photos and get him kinda grounded in a way. Idk if this will help but I'm willing to do anything.

523,Could you read me?,"Hi everyone. I'm 18. I just entered Reddit,and I don't know how to start but I just need to talk about this because I simply can't talk to anyone around me. The text that I'm about to write is going to be very long so I think many of you will not read. Doesn't matter, I just can't take this to myself anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the things I will describe might disturb some people. I don't even know if I'm allowed to post this. But here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a male, 18 years old (going to 19 next month) and I have been diagnosed with depression for the last three years. At first, I didn't know really what was the reason for my depression (that's why I always recommend people who don't have a actual reason to be depressed to go to therapy and take a deep look into your life. You might find something that was really hidden in your subconsciousness).

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that's what I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to tell the story of my life. For some reason, writing it helps me to process my thoughts. And yes, I want people to read it because I'm just terrible expressing myself in real life, and I just want people to know, but I don't have the courage to tell it in person.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. So I was born in Brazil (one of the reasons that I'm writing in English it's because I'm the only one in the family who speaks a little bit of English. So I'm sorry if there's some bad English here). The city that I was born is really violent, which is the reason why my mother wasn't very pleased with the idea of me going to play with other kids in the neighborhood. My father, worked his ass off during the week, but was an alcoholic, and once even tried to kill my mother. Nowadays, he's fine and they're still together. But those days were tough. So, since I was a child I was really close (and sometimes, hyper protected) to my momand the only other child company that I had was my brother, who is 3 years older than me. My brother is gay, and since always have been very feminine, and we used to play imitating pop singers and famous women. So I start to grew really feminine, but pay attention, I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE FACT THAT I WAS FEMININE IS BAD. But when I went to school, the thing was not pretty. I spent the years of 4 - 11 being extremely rejected by my male colleagues and being ""accused"" of wanting to be a woman and being gay. Sometimes I was interested in playing soccer like the other boys, but I knew that I would be bullied Everytime I was feminine (which was all the time). And these ""masculine"" activities would always have been a strange thing for me. My father was really interested in soccer, but never talk to me about it and my mother always rejected soccer (just like every other thing my father liked). My brother... Not interested. But I would still play with him of imitate female singers and sometimes, put a fake dress into us. It was pretty much this dynamic until 2010, when I was 9. My brother and I were still playing this, until, in some moment, he started to touch my penis and put my hands on his penis. I'm not gonna lie, I knew something ""wrong"" was happening, but I didn't actually think about it as sex. I didn't even knew what sex was, until the moment that he lay in the couch and put his penis, expecting me to blow it. Obviously, only now I realised that he wanted me to do oral sex on him, but at the time I didn't really know what he was wanting me to do. So I just stand there, paralized and nervously laughing. Later, he went to my front and put his butt in my penis and start dancing with it. I just felt so uncomfortable but couldn't get out, for some reason. I just remember crying hard at that night, just very disturbed. I just remember this fact very recently, with therapy. Since then it was just blocked from my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

At age ten, I didn't wanted to be known as a ""woman"" anymore. But my classmates didn't wanted to accept me as a boy. So I started to become very reclusive. Around that age I discovered horror films. And for the first time, I connected with male figures. It was Michael Myers, Freddy, leatherface. They seem to be treated just like me. And I started to wish to kill my mother. I would play with knives all the time, imagining to be a serial killer. It appeared to be my destiny. Next year, at 11, I receive the shocking news. My mother is pregnant, and the baby is a girl. I was indifferent to the girl until she was born. I'm so ashamed by this but I desired to rape her many times. One day, it was perfect to do it. It was only me and her. It was until I looked to her face. She was just a baby, I couldn't do this to her. I cried so much and I promised to myself that I wouldn't ever cause any harm to that girl. Ever. So I started to repress my admiration for psychopaths, and told myself that I wouldn't ever kill anyone. It seemed like the right thing to do. And it was 

&amp;#x200B;

 When I was 13, I tripped to my grandma's house, just like every year. My cousin, who is one year younger than me, was, probably the only boy I ever know that didn't saw anything wrong with me or that way I was.  Actually, I spent the best times of my childhood playing with him. But at 13, something changed. One day, we were together, watching a film. He started to touch my butt and I was uncomfortable, but somehow, I wanted that. He grabbed me and was trying to have sex. I denied several times but he was being violent, almost stroking me. Somehow I liked the violence. I was enjoying that way he was telling me to shut up. I consent to him so anal sex with me. When the violence was over and started the sex it was awful. It was the most unsatisfying experience I've ever had. I couldn't believed what I just did. I just ruined the only healthy male relationship that I had for a disgusting experience. I still didn't remembered what happened with my brother, but I tried to repress this memory as well. I wasn't successful.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, at 16, didn't saw any good thing in life anymore, and the memory of the sex that I had with my cousin was still in my mind. In therapy, I accepted that experience but it just seemed that something was wrong. Of course, it was around my whole life so it was very obvious: I'm gay. Right, I'm gay. Mom I'm gay. Dad, I'm gay. World, I'M GAY. Now I'm gonna be happy. Except that I wasn't. So I decided: I'm just gonna be happy when I kiss a man. I kissed. Three. And I hated. Once I kissed a girl, but she humiliated me in front of the whole class and said that was the worse kiss ever. The other girl I was interested rejected me totally. So I just said ""you what, I'm gay. I don't fucking care."" I surrounded myself with gay people, feeling that I would feel part of something for the first time. I didn't. I wasn't interested in any man, except the ones that treated me badly and bullied me. Those one were straight. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lived for two years as a gay man, that has never felt so unhappy in my life. Empty. The memory of what happened to me and my brother started to rise inside my head. But neglected it and just said ""it's normal, boys do that"". It was until the last year. when I was making coffee. I accidentally let it fall in my brother's body and, of course, he started screaming with me. At that moment, I just cried like never before. Since I was 10 I didn't cried. And I cried so hard and then hit me. I felt abused. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I'm going insane. He was only 12 when that happened, but somehow it was a different experience for me and for him. For him, it was just he exploring his sexuality. He continued his life wonderfully as a gay man. Making friends, dating men. And my life just seems ruined forever. But I can't accuse him of having abused me because I know he was only 12. How could I do that with him, when he probably didn't know what he would do with the rest of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I just can't love him. I hate him. Sometimes I wish he was dead. Then I blame myself because I know that if he dies I'm going to feel very guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't know. I don't know if I'm gay, straight, bisexual. God I even have considered the probability that I'm trans, autistic, mental I'll, once I even considerate that I have AIDS. But I don't, I already made blood test.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm becoming insane. Lately I have been considering suicide a lot but... I just can't do this to my sister. She's 7 now and I love her deeply. But, at the same time, if I tell this secret, I might ruin my family forever.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like I'm slowly dying. My childhood dreams have disappeared. I have no future. I don't what to do. I don't have friends.

&amp;#x200B;

If you read this entirely. I'm so grateful. I don't know who you are. But I love you. Thank you for being the only person that heard me.","Could you read me?Hi everyone. I'm 18. I just entered Reddit,and I don't know how to start but I just need to talk about this because I simply can't talk to anyone around me. The text that I'm about to write is going to be very long so I think many of you will not read. Doesn't matter, I just can't take this to myself anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the things I will describe might disturb some people. I don't even know if I'm allowed to post this. But here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a male, 18 years old (going to 19 next month) and I have been diagnosed with depression for the last three years. At first, I didn't know really what was the reason for my depression (that's why I always recommend people who don't have a actual reason to be depressed to go to therapy and take a deep look into your life. You might find something that was really hidden in your subconsciousness).

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that's what I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to tell the story of my life. For some reason, writing it helps me to process my thoughts. And yes, I want people to read it because I'm just terrible expressing myself in real life, and I just want people to know, but I don't have the courage to tell it in person.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. So I was born in Brazil (one of the reasons that I'm writing in English it's because I'm the only one in the family who speaks a little bit of English. So I'm sorry if there's some bad English here). The city that I was born is really violent, which is the reason why my mother wasn't very pleased with the idea of me going to play with other kids in the neighborhood. My father, worked his ass off during the week, but was an alcoholic, and once even tried to kill my mother. Nowadays, he's fine and they're still together. But those days were tough. So, since I was a child I was really close (and sometimes, hyper protected) to my momand the only other child company that I had was my brother, who is 3 years older than me. My brother is gay, and since always have been very feminine, and we used to play imitating pop singers and famous women. So I start to grew really feminine, but pay attention, I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE FACT THAT I WAS FEMININE IS BAD. But when I went to school, the thing was not pretty. I spent the years of 4 - 11 being extremely rejected by my male colleagues and being ""accused"" of wanting to be a woman and being gay. Sometimes I was interested in playing soccer like the other boys, but I knew that I would be bullied Everytime I was feminine (which was all the time). And these ""masculine"" activities would always have been a strange thing for me. My father was really interested in soccer, but never talk to me about it and my mother always rejected soccer (just like every other thing my father liked). My brother... Not interested. But I would still play with him of imitate female singers and sometimes, put a fake dress into us. It was pretty much this dynamic until 2010, when I was 9. My brother and I were still playing this, until, in some moment, he started to touch my penis and put my hands on his penis. I'm not gonna lie, I knew something ""wrong"" was happening, but I didn't actually think about it as sex. I didn't even knew what sex was, until the moment that he lay in the couch and put his penis, expecting me to blow it. Obviously, only now I realised that he wanted me to do oral sex on him, but at the time I didn't really know what he was wanting me to do. So I just stand there, paralized and nervously laughing. Later, he went to my front and put his butt in my penis and start dancing with it. I just felt so uncomfortable but couldn't get out, for some reason. I just remember crying hard at that night, just very disturbed. I just remember this fact very recently, with therapy. Since then it was just blocked from my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

At age ten, I didn't wanted to be known as a ""woman"" anymore. But my classmates didn't wanted to accept me as a boy. So I started to become very reclusive. Around that age I discovered horror films. And for the first time, I connected with male figures. It was Michael Myers, Freddy, leatherface. They seem to be treated just like me. And I started to wish to kill my mother. I would play with knives all the time, imagining to be a serial killer. It appeared to be my destiny. Next year, at 11, I receive the shocking news. My mother is pregnant, and the baby is a girl. I was indifferent to the girl until she was born. I'm so ashamed by this but I desired to rape her many times. One day, it was perfect to do it. It was only me and her. It was until I looked to her face. She was just a baby, I couldn't do this to her. I cried so much and I promised to myself that I wouldn't ever cause any harm to that girl. Ever. So I started to repress my admiration for psychopaths, and told myself that I wouldn't ever kill anyone. It seemed like the right thing to do. And it was 

&amp;#x200B;

 When I was 13, I tripped to my grandma's house, just like every year. My cousin, who is one year younger than me, was, probably the only boy I ever know that didn't saw anything wrong with me or that way I was.  Actually, I spent the best times of my childhood playing with him. But at 13, something changed. One day, we were together, watching a film. He started to touch my butt and I was uncomfortable, but somehow, I wanted that. He grabbed me and was trying to have sex. I denied several times but he was being violent, almost stroking me. Somehow I liked the violence. I was enjoying that way he was telling me to shut up. I consent to him so anal sex with me. When the violence was over and started the sex it was awful. It was the most unsatisfying experience I've ever had. I couldn't believed what I just did. I just ruined the only healthy male relationship that I had for a disgusting experience. I still didn't remembered what happened with my brother, but I tried to repress this memory as well. I wasn't successful.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, at 16, didn't saw any good thing in life anymore, and the memory of the sex that I had with my cousin was still in my mind. In therapy, I accepted that experience but it just seemed that something was wrong. Of course, it was around my whole life so it was very obvious: I'm gay. Right, I'm gay. Mom I'm gay. Dad, I'm gay.

288,Deleting everything,"I’ve thought about it a lot these past few months. I want to completely wipe all of my electronics and just get rid of them. There’s nothing bad on them or anything, I just don’t want to deal with it anymore. The only thing stopping me from doing so is my online friend. We’ve been friends for about 3 years and he’s the most supportive person I’ve ever had in my life. If I get rid of everything, I won’t be able to talk to him anymore. Part of me doesn’t want to stay in touch with him though. It may sound weird but I feel like if I lose touch with someone important in my life such as him, I’d have an excuse to cut ties with everyone else. I know it doesn’t make much sense. 

It’s not only that though. I want to get rid of a majority of the things I own and I want to stop talking to people altogether.

I wish I could just run away but I don’t know what I’m trying to run away from. I wish I could start life over again, but we all know that can’t happen. My original plan was just to move far away when I turn 18, leave everything behind, and never look back. I don’t know what I want to do or even what I should do.","Deleting everythingI’ve thought about it a lot these past few months.

56,I have been severely depressed and it is affecting my school work and looking for advice,"Since I've hit my 20's, my depression has just plummeted. In high school, I hadn't been diagnosed yet with my anxiety and depression, and even though it was present it didn't feel nearly as bad as this.

I haven't been keeping up with classes, I have been failing exams and I don't have nearly enough credits to keep my scholarship for my junior year. I have fucked myself so badly with school I don't know what to do. I want so badly to take a leave of absence to get myself together, up my medication and see a therapist. I really want to get better. However, if I take a leave from school I will lose all financial aid for my junior year as well. My fiancé and I are pretty financially responsible people and have budgeted out for the next year and a half based on the financial aid we both receive. It is not an option to lose that money or we will be completely fucked. I am asking advice on what to do. I need to take a break from school or I will just keep digging myself deeper into this GPA and depression nightmare, but we also can't lose any money from it.

I have always been an introvert but I am now having difficulty just thinking what to do next. I don't have a job and don't have any friends who are near to me. Everytime something bad happens I automatically try thinking of the worst possible consequences of my actions. I don't want this fear in my life. Also I'm having difficulty doing normal things. I would keep procrastinating to avoid accepting the situation I'm in and making things better. I have been thinking of suicide a lot these days but I know that's not the answer.

1935,I dont love/like my mother and idk if the relationship is worth salvaging.,"Im (28m) shes (49f)There's a lot of backstory here so ill try to sum up some main points for context. My mother has substance abuse issues all through my life. It caused me to live with my grandparents multiple timea in my life from 3-6 then again from 11-16 til my grandmother died and i had nowhere else to go. I ended up living with her due to some medical issues for myself at the time i had to drop out of school.and get my GED and a job. She made me pay rent 250 a month full time 40 hours a week back then i was making roughly 280 dollars a week. Whatever pay rent no problem even though Id be more supportive of my kid going through a terrible time but whatever. I also had to pay for my own food and such.The problem was a lot. My room was storage for her and her boyfriend i literally had just a bed and the rest were boxes of junk the boyfriend who was a hoarder didnt want to throw out. On top of that he was a terrible person who would constantly bad mouth my mother, steal my weed and other things from my room(i actually caught him on camera and showed him and he still denied it to my face.) One day he did it in front of me and i beat the shit outta him and i ended up leaving and sleeping on friends couches etc. Now at the time I would've fucking killed for my mother. So her picking him over me kinda broke my heart back then but it is what it is. Fast forward a couple years(20) i ended up living back with her doing the same stuff but this time at least i had a room that didnt have junk in it. But the abusive boyfriend was still there and it was the same pay rent and.  all of my food. She starts letting her friends from the methadone clinic she goes too stay in the house...for FREE🤦‍♂️. Another thing she been on methadone for like 13 years, that's not how methadone should work but fuck it im no doctor. 4 years later she makes a big deal about money and all this stuff and i go to find out that, first she never used my money to pay rent, it turned out from me talking to our landlord that she owed almost 6 months of backrent! I also found out that the boyfriend didn't contribute to any of the finances so at a young age she put her financial responsibility in my hands. We ended up getting evicted and I was pissed and didnt talk to her for 2 years then she got cancer. So i did what i felt was the right thing and was there for her regardless. She got better and now well this whole thing came from a argument the other day we had. I have major depression and i was trying to ask for help and she got mad at me cause i told her i can't talk to her about it. She asked why and i told her the truth that i dont wanna have a who had a sadder life competition. Because she has a habit of if i was to complain about my childhood instead of listening or sympathizing she would bring up things like oh i was molested my childhood wasn't that great. Yeah that's fucking terrible and all that but that doesn't excuse your decision for you children. You're supposed to work to make things better for them. Which is the only valuable life lesson she taught me, because she never did it. Now im in a ok place I'm in school full time work 2 jobs all so i can have a easier life, and she don't understand that I'm busy even though i told her this. Honestly she's the reason for a lot of my depression. it sucks having to coddle a parent, i have no guidance i feel lost half the time and she will never understand that.","I dont love/like my mother and idk if the relationship is worth salvaging.Im (28m) shes (49f)There's a lot of backstory here so ill try to sum up some main points for context.

They're currently angry at me and they're blocking the wifi and my sim card for no apparent reason and I just feel so helpless. I can't talk to them or make them understand how I feel.

They take away my phone whenever they're upset and I'm stuck in the house because of quarantine and I just dont know what to do. And to make it a little clear, my real dad was an abusive alcoholic and my mother STILL says stuff like that to me.

I feel angry whenever someone talks down to me, and I want to hurt and kill people when it gets bad. I know it's wrong, but I don't know what to do, and how to not feel like this. I can't talk to my family about this because they are the direct problem. I hate them and want them out of my life. I live in a boarding school, in a different country from them, but when I do see them, it always makes me worse.

80,I am a toxic person and I want to not be like this anymore.,"I am a 27 year old man who has recently come to the conclusion that he is toxic. Here's why.

I cannot tell if I do not care about anybody else's feelings other than my own, and I only do things to get something for myself. If I've fucked up in a relationship or I've hurt someone I loved, I apologise. Even if I am right, I apologise because my father taught me that is the way to do things in relationships with people.  I am always the nice guy in the relationships/friendships and I've started to think that I'm just some beta-male that should've been discarded a long time ago. I have no confidence in my social abilities and I often feel lonely as a result, but then when I am with others I usually feel like a black sheep and/or get irritated with the company to the point where I don't want to be around them.

I just got a promotion in my job and didn't even smile or think that it was a good thing. My boss even questioned me if I was happy or excited, to which I replied 'yes' straight-faced. I am confident in my abilities in my job and it is not boring or mundane, but I place no value on it because jobs are something we must do in order to survive. Nothing excites me anymore. I have lost passion for everything. And I just wallow about in self-pity, trying not to become distraught through rage or unhappiness. Until recently I was calling up my parents almost every day enraged or crying with despair. I am sick of dragging everyone down with me because of my emotional outrage.

Thus, I have made the decision to cut off all contact with everyone I know, family included. My gut feeling is telling me to never speak to anyone ever again because I am so sick of trying. Trying to please everyone, trying to better myself, and trying to do anything.

I never take to the internet in search for solutions, but if anyone knows how to change their attitude so that they may continue on the pursuit for happiness, then please, I beg of you, share your wisdom. I don't want to be this person.","I am a toxic person and I want to not be like this anymore.I am a 27 year old man who has recently come to the conclusion that he is toxic. Here's why.

661,The current situation has caused a HUGE setback,"Hey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am. 

A bit of background: I'm a California girl in my 50's. And, I've struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. I've got a claim for SSDI, but apparently I'm not sick enough. SMH   I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldn't breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight.

I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. I'm not ashamed to say I was Daddy's Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband.

So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. 

Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid-19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my mother-in-law for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed.
I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning. Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, I'll never go hungry. So since I'm disabled, waiting for benefits, my rent is $50/month. I also had internet shut off because I couldn't pay them (just $50 too. My needs are small) I've had help from friends and family, and then eventually from several local church charities.

 And, well, I've run out of options and was scrolling through Reddit. I saw a couple of subs in which to ask for help. So I took a deep breath and posted how I need help paying my bills. The only reason I did this is that I have seen many messages of gratitude from individuals who received help. But that didn't happen for me. In fact there were some negative responses, and both posts where completely down voted. So, I guess either I don't know how to ask for help, or people just don't care. Let's add to my situation that my one good friend is going through some of their own challenges, and being a complete jerk. I've heard that the economic stimulus package won't pay anyone who is not working. Figures, the people who need it the most get nothing. And I pray it is only a rumour, because $1000 could set me up for many months while I work on my disability claim. The California Governor has issued a ""shelter in place"" order. I have asthma pretty badly, so I'm party of the group that SERIOUSLY shouldn't go out. Same with my mother-in-law.

My anxiety and depression had returned in full force. I have thought, again of giving up on my life. There is really NOTHING good about it. At all. My sister has shunned me because she knows nothing about mental health, and thinks I should just ""be happy."" I've never really had any meaningful relationship with my mom. She has been emotionally unavailable my entire life. 

So what am I left with? A complete shut down. No news, or Internet. (I'm typing on my government phone which has very limited data. But at least I can post) My friend is unavailable. Yesterday I went to my mother-in-law's place so I could download some movies. It's really exasperating to be so helpless, and so tired of my f**ked up life, and so sad, and no real prospects in paying my measly $100/month bills. And when I reach out, it either goes sideways or I am ignored. I can't eat or I get very nauseous (die to my anxiety and a medical issue with my stomach.

Why don't I deserve the help I really need? I literally have nothing to live for. And I don't know what to do.","The current situation has caused a HUGE setbackHey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am.

I have the feeling of being watched the whole time of something not human but humanlike.
I am so tiered at this very moment. 
I flinch at every sound and getting kicked out of my sleep even its just the crackling of the wooden floor. 
I am afraid of opening doors because I am scared of opening doors, because I fear there is something in the room, waiting for me.
It all started with one crappy horror movie which was not even scary. It was really bad with huge logical gaps. I even laughed at it in the first place. But now? It is like my brain was rewriting the story just to intimidate me.    
But every time I talk to a family member it is just like it never existed. But as soon I close the door it is starting all over again. 
Every time I think I can sleep now, I just get the feeling again if something is approching me and heading for my neck. Even right now
Pls guys help me. I am so tiered. I can't think anymore. This was the only thing that came into my mind. 
Maybe it is helpful to know, but I got ADHD as well. I don't know.

1699,Loving one is Depressed :/," 

Hey guys,

so i was ""daiting"" with a girl and after trying and trying she couldnt get any feelings for me.

We got into a big conversation about it after 2 months. She never told anybody and never ever talked about it with somebody. She told me that she is Depressed. I asked for some reasons and when it started. She told me that it started in high school because her parents have really high hopes in her and pressuring her pretty much. She is 19 now. I feel like (she told me as well) the reason why she can't love me is because of her depression. I told her that im ready to help her anytime and all. But she doesnt want help and really doesnt like it when others help her. She doesnt cry infront of anyone because thats a symbole of weakness she tells me. I really care about her. It even feels like it hurts me more then her to a point. I dont know what to do. And i feel like if i will be there for her that one day she might feel how it is to love somebody. Since she told me that she never loved someone really. So if anyone could give me a tip on how to handle the situation that would be the greatest thing ever.

I also asked her this question on a scale to 0-10 if 0 is: that she loves her life and most things are going well and 10 is: i want to kill myself as soon as possible. She answered 8. I'm really concerned. And getting a therapist isn't an option as well for her. She would never take any pills either or so. She isnt Religious, she feels the ""best"" if she is just alone and if she has her quietness. She feels pressured if she is outside with her friends etc.. She also doesn't find relationships appealing. Maybe because she never had a good/real one with feelings but that is just an assumption. She has guilty feelings because she started daiting me and wishes me to find a better one. She doesnt really like herself etc etc. Dont understand me wrong. Outside she is a extrovert, like nobody would know that she is actually depressed im sure. She acts like a woman that is really happy with most things. But some sings i could read told me how she things about certain themes..

Please i beg you guys please help me to find a way to help her. Thats the only thing that would make me happy. I would give everything for her to slowly feel ""normal"" again. I want to be her saviour/hero :(..

1238,I honestly don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing. Please help.,"I’m standing in the shower writing this because I’m so lost.
I feel a total lack of motivation to to do anything.
I’ve slept most of the day, each day this week. I’ve barely eaten anything other than chips and junk. Nothing I own or could stream seems worth watching. I consider myself a gamer, but everything I could play seems like a waste of time and energy.
I don’t even want to work or make money because what’s the point if everything you could buy with those earnings is just going to sit on a shelf.

It’s not just ‘right now’ either. I’ve always felt like this. It’s just exacerbated to the level it’s at now over the last year or so.
I take medication per my physician, but I feel like it’s so hot and cold on if it seems to do anything at all.

I honestly don’t expect anyone to give me any meaningful advice... not the first time I’ve decided to scream into the nether — probably won’t be the last.","I honestly don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing. Please help.I’m standing in the shower writing this because I’m so lost.

116,How do I gauge the success of my antidepressant without knowing what the “best case scenario” actually feels like?,"At this moment in time, I am on 60mg prozac a day.

It has been a few months of increasing the dose and I’d like to believe it has been helping me, but I can’t tell if it’s all in my head or if it is just coincidence I have been having one or two good days a week instead of none. 

prozac is the only antidepressant I have been prescribed over the years, and while I am hesitant to try something unfamiliar, the idea that there might be a more effective medication crosses my mind frequently.

I struggle greatly with low energy levels/ motivation/ fatigue and it would suck to know that all of this time I could have been pursuing a prescription that was a better fit. I feel like I have been making decisions blindly simply because I don’t have the experience of another antidepressant to compare the effectiveness.

721,How do you get past feelings of guilt?,"Hi everyone,

I've been recently wondering what to do to get past feelings of guilt over past mistakes and wrongdoings. I know that I hurt some close friends quite badly when I was severely depressed. (I'm not using it as an excuse for my behaviour, as I still said the terrible things and was unkind to them.) Now, I've looked at those mistakes, spoken to people and have been working to make myself a better person and hopefully a better friend to other people in the future. 

Given all of this, how can I get over the feelings of guilt over what was said? I know it's not healthy to hold onto such feelings but at the same time, I'm not sure how to stop thinking about those actions and feeling bad.

I've read somewhere that as we grow, learn and improve from our mistakes and to forgive ourselves, but I am not sure what techniques to try in order to do this.

Thank you for reading :)","How do you get past feelings of guilt?Hi everyone,

277,My Government won't support my parents any longer for having me,"Disclaimers: Never posted on reddit before, but I don't know who else to talk to.   
The grammar will be off because I am quite upset as I type this, my apologies. 

  
Quick backstory: I've suffered from depression ever since I was around 16, now I'm soon-to-be 25. I tried seeing a therapist back when I was 18 and started university. She was truly awful and I thought I had no right to see a therapist. 

Fast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still haven't finished university. I'm trying but failing. I'm incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I don't get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon won't have the governments support because I'm too old to count as a child. 

I just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. They're not made of money, and although my mom said she won't kick me out, I know she's growing impatient. She's having  a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. 

  
I struggle very hard not to let the thought of ""ending it all so they'll be better of"" take over. Because I know my mom won't be better of knowing I've commited suicide. I don't want to die. I just can't live.  Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this?

  
I should talk to my therapist about this, I know. But my next session won't be for another 2 weeks.","My Government won't support my parents any longer for having meDisclaimers: Never posted on reddit before, but I don't know who else to talk to.

464,Please give me some advice. I really need it.,"       Hi! This is my first time talking about my problems online so I will write a lot. If you stay to read everything, thank you, I appreciate it, because I really need it.
       So, I am almost 17 and I have depression since back in secondary school. I am always isolated by my colleagues, who only use me when they need to. Even so, I am always there for them although not the other way around. In my country being selfish is in power, but my parents raised me to be kind and modest so its pretty hard for me to find any friend. Besides that, my parents treat me very badly, always yelling at me or punishing me out of nothing, sometimes pretending I don't even exist. They don't believe me even if I tell the truth and don't ever encourage me. Because of that i became shy and introverted. 
      The only friend I had , who started talking to me two years ago, becaming my bestfriend and also my first love later, changed completely when she got into highschool, got a boyfriend and threw me aside even if I told her about my depression and she knew I really needed her. Now I am alone and I got used to it, but I need someone be there for me and my loneliness only makes me feel more depressed.
      I always avoid going out with my parents because I feel like shit with them but I hate myself for it and their disappointed looks break my heart. The only way to escape from reality is my phone, but I started using it too often, watching night after night anime even if I have severe myopia. I constantly feel tired, I have no motivation to do anything, I don't seem to be able to love someone anymore and I really can't see myself in the future. The reason I write this is because today I had a nightmare with that girl and when I woke up my chest was hurting so bad and I screwed up with my parents.
     If anyone has come so far, thanks again, and sorry about my bad English. I really need some advice : What should i do? How can I escape this?","Please give me some advice.

1314,How does one even find a will to live in this situation?,"I am completely and utterly lost as to how to justify continuing with my life. I live in a small town, I have no car, and I barely make enough money to afford rent even while working 6-7 days a week. 

I have no health insurance and I’m falling apart at 25 due to all the health issues I can’t afford to deal with or even get them properly diagnosed. 

My family despises me because I’m gay. I don’t even care about that anymore, but I have no lifelines to help with anything. 

My husband lives 12 hours away and it’s been my goal for 4 years now to get to him, but I can’t afford it, and even if I could, I don’t have a car to get a job once I’m down there. He won’t help me even though he makes 70k a year because I “don’t have the right mindset” but I don’t understand how my mindset could possibly be any different under the circumstances. I have been through every job in town and several out of town that I couldn’t even get to for very long, and the shitty job I have now is the best paying one. 

I don’t have the money or time to go to school, but that’s all anyone ever suggests. I’m not even at home 12 hours a week, yet I’m supposed to somehow get to a community college in another city for 16 hours a week, plus 30-40 hours of reading and homework? There literally are not enough hours in a week for that to work, and that’s not even accounting for the money I don’t have that it would cost me. 

It doesn’t make any sense. I’m grinding my face into the pavement just trying to make ends meet in a life I don’t even want anymore. I can’t even fathom what’s stopping me from ending it right now, other than some primal instinct to survive. I have zero reason to go on.","How does one even find a will to live in this situation?I am completely and utterly lost as to how to justify continuing with my life.

My husband lives 12 hours away and it’s been my goal for 4 years now to get to him, but I can’t afford it, and even if I could, I don’t have a car to get a job once I’m down there. He won’t help me even though he makes 70k a year because I “don’t have the right mindset” but I don’t understand how my mindset could possibly be any different under the circumstances. I have been through every job in town and several out of town that I couldn’t even get to for very long, and the shitty job I have now is the best paying one. 

I don’t have the money or time to go to school, but that’s all anyone ever suggests. I’m not even at home 12 hours a week, yet I’m supposed to somehow get to a community college in another city for 16 hours a week, plus 30-40 hours of reading and homework? There literally are not enough hours in a week for that to work, and that’s not even accounting for the money I don’t have that it would cost me. 

It doesn’t make any sense. I’m grinding my face into the pavement just trying to make ends meet in a life I don’t even want anymore. I can’t even fathom what’s stopping me from ending it right now, other than some primal instinct to survive. I have zero reason to go on.",my_life life live ion mall car bar town ford money king rent day small_town week work live days nose alt art health insurance deal ford fall health_issues gay family my_family car life help ban job car band husband ford my_husband year live year rent right help mind set job pay town school time money reading city community_college community home unity week work nit homework college accounting money week work cost end grind life face grinding meet men end ending right fat reason son,"[['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'no'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'no'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]"
1501,It's been 3 weeks of active depression,"Idk how I should start off as but, I'm 17 and in yr 11 I only have this year and next year to fix my stuff up with my grades. Lately I've been feeling really depressed about my exams and my sacs (School Assessed Coursework). I ended up finding that these exams this year don't count to anything and I just wasted my time falling apart over it. And I'm feeling sad that I'm not doing well the way I want to. I tried reaching out to my friends, talking about how I feel, they even said whenever I'm depressed or feel like hurting myself(btw with hurting myself I only did it a few times and haven't done it in like a year) just to come to them for help, they said that they cared but they don't. I tried this morning to reach out.... I got blocked, I'm not really a person with much friends but I usually just talk to my irl friends on social media. It helps to have someone to talk to, but now I have no one. No one really cares about me or checks up on me, I'm mostly talking about my friends about this, my parents sometimes check up. But I need that attention for someone to give me, without it I just feel alone and scared. Now I just feel so alone in the wide open world, idk where I see myself going in life, idk what to do, I keep taking days off from school because I feel like im gonna have another meltdown there. I cried at school and felt so embarrassed and even more sadder when people noticed and stared at me. I just feel pathetic. This whole morning I've felt being sad and cried, now my pillow is wet with tears. I've tried watching YouTube videos to distract myself but nothing is helping, that's why I'm deciding right now to try seek help from here. Idk what to ask for but I just want some support.","It's been 3 weeks of active depressionIdk how I should start off as but, I'm 17 and in yr 11 I only have this year and next year to fix my stuff up with my grades.

86,How can I (32F) stop feeling like such a burden to my husband (36M)?,"I am going through a very difficult time after two miscarriages in the past couple of months and a recurrence of depression and anxiety symptoms. He works about an hour away, while I work from home, although I have very little work, so most of my days are just spent doing...well, nothing. I'm sometimes so depressed I can't keep up with basic chores, which I feel I should be doing since I'm home all day. My husband hasn't confronted me about it directly but I think it annoys him.

&amp;#x200B;

Some days I feel okay. Other days I am irrational, fearful and tearful. I have a huge fear that he will leave me, which I have expressed to him--and which he always denies, but I know it must get annoying that I keep bringing it up, though I can't seem to help myself. I can't imagine how annoying and difficult it must be for him to come home from work and not know if he's coming home to see me on an ""okay day"" or a really bad day.

&amp;#x200B;

Our communication isn't bad, but I've recently felt myself pulling away and trying to rely on my own inner strength, but sometimes that backfires and I do a 180 and turn into an absolute mess with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like he deserves so much better than having basically a half-wife who is so unsteady. Does anyone have any tips/mantras/etc. for making me feel just...better about how much of a burden I am placing on him? I am talking to a therapist once a week and on medication, but I am still really struggling with these feelings of feeling unworthy and pathetic.","How can I (32F) stop feeling like such a burden to my husband (36M)?I am going through a very difficult time after two miscarriages in the past couple of months and a recurrence of depression and anxiety symptoms.

337,I'm fed up,"I take my meds, I go to therapy, but nothing is sticking. I do everything right but I keep failing again, and again. I know I need to get out of my own head. I know I need to break out of this unhealthy way of thinking, but my brain just won't do it! I hate how I come across as lazy. I'm exhausted. 

This is my third attempt at trying to get my Bachelors. I only have a semseter left. Each time I try to graduate, something horrible happens, I get hospitalized for suicide, I get assaulted, and my mother dies. Now I'm constantly bracing myself for more suffering, and I end up creating it by panicking instead of doing my assignments. I'm making this harder on myself then it has to be. 

I feel guilt for being a financial burden on my father, I feel shame for not moving on with my life like my peers. I hate not having friends, and being a hermit. I really don't want to move back in with my father, because he hoards, and my depression will only get worse. All I want to be is financially independent. I want to be a functioning member of society. 

It's also been a struggle to get my ADHD meds, I'm a mess, and can't keep events straight. I got the date wrong yet again. I keep sleeping the day away. It took all my effort to put on jeans, and cook myself breakfast this morning. One load of dishes and I'm exhausted. I'm sick of it!

44,I feel like I can’t talk to anyone,"Recently my boyfriend (the only person I’ve talked to about my seasonal depression) told me that he thinks I’m too emotionally dependent on him. I understand why he says that (as previously stated he’s the only person I’ll talk to) and I understand that he said it because he’s worried. But it makes me feel like I can’t talk to him either anymore.

I guess my reaction to what he said just proves that I am emotionally dependent on him but I just need someone I trust to talk to, but recently my best friend has become someone I barely recognize. I don’t have anyone else to talk to, now I don’t have anyone.

1221,Brushing your teeth when really depressed?,"I had a bit of a dental scare recently and was able to end up brushing and flossing twice a day for a month until I was able to get to the dentist- I think this brushing was caused almost entirely by anxiety.

I went to the dentist, and they said no cavities, but when they did gum measurements ""there were some pockets of 4 and some bleeding, which we don't like to see."" They didn't exactly clarify what this meant, so I was like ""ah ok i'm fine"" and went back to my normal routine of basically never brushing my teeth because I can barely even get out of bed to pee.

I ended up looking up what the ""pocket of 4 with bleeding meant""  a week later and it said gum disease and bone loss, so obviously now I'm spiraling about all of my teeth falling out and having to get either numerous implants or dentures in my 20s...

The point is, I do need to not only maintain my oral hygeine, but at the moment I need to actively improve it before I get too far.

Anxiety will push me along for now, but I know that soon I will start to feel like my gums have recovered enough (even if they haven't), or just forget why I'm anxious, and I'll stop brushing.

Do you have recommendations for how to actually get myself into a habit to brush and floss my teeth- not just ""chew some xylitol gum"" or ""keep mouthwash by your bed and spit it into a water bottle""? Thanks","Brushing your teeth when really depressed?I had a bit of a dental scare recently and was able to end up brushing and flossing twice a day for a month until I was able to get to the dentist- I think this brushing was caused almost entirely by anxiety.

1167,"My uncle is getting severely depressed, how to help him.","So my uncle recently unfriended a toxic friend who drained him off his money, convinced him to unfriend all of his friends and introduced him to alcohol and drugs but after he unfriended him he became really lonely and started getting intoxicated even more, almost stopped going to his job and talking really pessimistic( like wanting to kill himself and what is the use of living anymore). I don't know how to help him, whether to seek professional help or to do something else. I am really sad and in pain from seeing him spoil his life and health like this. He roams around wearing the same shirt and not even admitting he is depressed.

380,Is this a toxic friend,"I am a shy and private person. Thus as s result i don't have a lot of friends, for a year and half i have been friend with s girl of my sm age (i am 19y m). I was really happy to get a friend like her she was supportive and caring but for the past six moths i have noticed that she was not replying to my text , tbh i thought it was fine and thought because of the semester. (We are classmates). I have noticed that she only act Friendly when she need to. I thought it was also fine as she may be nervous to ask for favours but for a past month i have noticed that she completely stop texted me (just a few days ago she asked about our friendship beyond college). This seems very suspicious. I don't know what have gone wrong. I see her as my friend still. It's okay to break friendship if one party thinks it. The problem lies whenever i ask if she wants to stop me texting she don't reply but actually tries to avoid it. I have now seen it was a weak spot for me. She was my only friend and i am not open to my family. Now because of this my concentration and mental stability is gone (i suffer from schizophrenia). I don't know if what happening is real or i am making the stuff up. Anyway despite of knowing everything she is not coming clean. I suspect she don't want me be her friend anymore (and it's fine,) but she is not telling me that because of the help ,/ benifit. I don't know what to do i also can't concentrate on anything i would like to know your advice. As i need a other prospective.

Has anyone else felt like this? 
Even little things seems to trigger my desire to just die. The stress of buying a home is triggering these thoughts. 
I feel stupid for wanting to die every time bad things or inconveniences happen to me. What’s wrong with me? 
If i just shoot myself w a gun or die of a horrible car accident, all my problem and stress would just go away. I wouldn’t have to worry about being all these problems in my life.

The only thing stopping me are my kids and husband. Who’s gunna take care of them? My kids cant grow up without a mom. 
But idk how much longer I can continue. Ive tried getting professional help...it doesnt work. 
Nothing will make these thoughts go away. Ive been depressed my whole life. 
I just want to give up already. im tired.","When I encounter problems, even not so big, my mind automatically goes to “I just want to die. Would all the pain and stress go away if i just die?”

492,"Fantasy brings me much more pleasure than reality, so how can I enjoy life again?","I've been struggling with depression for +10 years, and I'm at a point where I'm ready to just throw my hands up, and give up trying to find joy in the real world anymore. I've always turned to some form of escapism as a coping strategy, whether it's gaming, cartoons, or even just watching random YT videos. Now, I feel like I would just be happier if I could live in that escapism all the time. If there was a way I could just spend my life sleeping and dreaming all the time, I would.

Even my therapist has acknowledged that life won't be as much fun as living in a gaming world or watching cartoons, so what's the point? So far, the main answer seems to be ""you just have to do it."" I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live either. I'm convinced nothing would make me happier than if I were to live in my own head.","Fantasy brings me much more pleasure than reality, so how can I enjoy life again?I've been struggling with depression for +10 years, and I'm at a point where I'm ready to just throw my hands up, and give up trying to find joy in the real world anymore.

1356,Can i get my life in order? I need help,"Hi this is first time i m doing this. I just wanted to start somewhere but i m not sure where. I am 30 years old now and i have problems with my life for a long time. I havent graduated from university, i m a student for almost 11 years i just have 3 more classes to graduate but most of the times i cant find the energy to study due to long time depression. For a liltle background i can say that i have been bullied a lot in high school and it left emotional scars on me. Before my current problem with school i had no problem with classes and other studies, like i could easily understand the problem and start on solutions. But now i get scared even to open up my notes to study. I am constantly in fear that i wasted my life and i will never be successful in life. I have no work talent especially in my work field, even though i did some job now and then. I have no idea if i can recover from my mistakes. If i can graduate i ll become electronics engineer but i have no idea what field i can work nor where to start. I learned a bit russian out of curiosity but it was so long ago. I dont know what else to write. U can ask anything i ll try to answer. Thanks for reading","Can i get my life in order? I need helpHi this is first time i m doing this.
